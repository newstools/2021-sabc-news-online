Six people have been arrested for allegedly being in possession of abalone at St Francis Bay in the Eastern Cape. This follows a tip-off to the police about suspected poachers. Police spokesperson Mali Govender says police closely monitored the suspects’ vehicle and followed them to a house in Malema village where they found diving equipment and three bags with 320 abalones with a street value of R18 000. Govender says the suspects will appear in court.
