African National Congress (ANC) deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte says the leaked clips of their Special National Executive Congress (NEC) meeting to the media over the weekend have created an impression of an organisation in crisis. She says the NEC has expressed concern about members who allegedly leaked the clips. Duarte briefed the media at the party headquarters at Luthuli House in Johannesburg on Tuesday. “We noted with concern the continued factional divisions and divisive public pronouncements which make an impression of an organisation in crisis. As you know a portion of a clip that one of our provincial chairs was making a statement is the only thing that resonated over the weekend. Let me dispel the fact that he did not talk about the ANC … trying to build itself from the ground up.” Below is the ANC NEC meeting outcomes media briefing:  On Monday, ANC veteran Mavuso Msimang said some senior party members who have been charged with serious crimes, including corruption, are the ones who are leaking what is being discussed in the party’s meetings to the media. The governing party’s highest decision-making body instructed all members who face criminal charges to step aside within 30 days or be suspended. Suspended secretary-general Ace Magashule, Member of Parliament Bongani Bongo and KwaZulu-Natal ANC deputy chairperson Mike Mabuyakhulu are some of those charged.
