Six suspects and a bystander have been killed in a shoot-out with police during a botched business robbery at Mtubatuba on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. Police are investigating a case of attempted business robbery, attempted murder, possession of illegal firearms and ammunition as well as an inquest into the death of the bystander. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says a number of suspects fled the scene. “The police officers from Durban Task Force were following them and there was an exchange of gunfire. Six suspects believed to be in their thirties were declared dead at the scene. A total of three illegal firearms with 31 rounds of ammunition were recovered from the deceased suspects. A 33-year-old bystander sustained an injury on the leg and was taken to a local clinic where he later died. A suspect’s vehicle was recovered and impounded for further investigation. The other suspects, who were travelling in three vehicles, managed to flee the scene and they are still being sought by police.”
