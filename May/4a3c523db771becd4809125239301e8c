Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize says the numbers of vaccine doses that are currently coming into South Africa will not be enough to last the next two months. Mkhize says between now and June the country should have received six million doses. He says government is trying to get more vaccines but because of the delays, the deliveries will be received later in the year. Mkhize says they are hoping to vaccinate 16-million people countrywide in the second phase of the COVID-19 vaccination programme.

Mkhize says they are looking at delaying the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine as evidence from Britain indicate that people who have delayed taking the second dose developed stronger immunity against COVID-19. He was addressing the media following the inspection of the COVID-19 vaccination site at the Royal Showgrounds in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal. “We have said that we are targeting ultimately to use over 3 300 sites by end of September. We want to have wrapped up our vaccination to all the 250 000 people per day. With the second phase, we are looking at 16 million people to be vaccinated in this process. We’ll be doing the first and second phase. We want our people to be very patient,” says Mkhize.
