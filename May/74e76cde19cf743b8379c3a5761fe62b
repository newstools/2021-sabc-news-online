The Limpopo Health Department plans to administer COVID-19 vaccines at community halls, churches, schools, and other easy-to-access public venues in and around villages across the province. The province aims to make access to the vaccine convenient to rural communities, as it anticipates receiving more doses in the weeks ahead. Currently, Community healthcare workers have been visiting the homes of the elderly to register them for phase two of the vaccination programme. Health MEC, Dr Phophi Ramathuba, says they will open new vaccination sites, mostly in rural areas when they receive new doses. “We will be going to villages, last week we were at Sekutupi, where we have been able to vaccinate, again, it is an old age home. We will continue to do that. We will continue moving, you’ll see us going to churches in the community using the church hall. You will see us using the traditional halls where we will be able to vaccinate them.” Meanwhile, Christina Muthulane, who has been registered for the vaccine by community health care workers in Magodu village outside Polokwane, says she is happy that this was done in the comfort of her home. “I’m happy that they have come to my home to register me. My feet hurt and I struggle to go to the clinic and old age grant pay point, so I would not have been able to register if it wasn’t for them.” Progress being made in the Phase Two vaccine rollout:
