Mangaung city manager Tankiso Mea has been suspended following calls from the Democratic Alliance and shutdown protesters. This is to allow for an investigation into alleged irregular expenditure and lack of service delivery. Community members of Mangaung embarked on a three-day shutdown last week demanding the removal of the city manager and the disbandment of the council. Provincial government leadership and shutdown leaders met to discuss a way forward to deal with the issues raised. Businesses, schools and public transport came to a standstill following the shutdown. Mangaung Metro spokesperson Qondile Khedama said: “The council meeting on Friday saw the suspension of the city manager and a person was appointed pending the investigation.” The Mangaung Metro was placed under administration in December 2019 and has been downgraded twice by Moody’s rating agency. During the protests, shutdown organiser Themba Zweni said, “We plead with the learners and workers not to go to work and only essential workers would be allowed to go through. Only buses and taxis taking these essential workers would be permitted to go through to work.” Zweni added that residents have been subjected to poor service delivery for a long time. Last month, the Democratic Alliance in the Free State called for an investigation into the city manager. Allegations against Mea include financial mismanagement, unauthorised and wasteful expenditure, as outlined in the video below:
