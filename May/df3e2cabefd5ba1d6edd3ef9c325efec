The  African National Congress (ANC) has given its suspended Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, 48 hours to apologise publicly for the suspension letter he sent to party President Cyril Ramaphosa. Last week, after being suspended for failing to step aside in line with the National Executive Committee (NEC) resolution, that members facing criminal charges must volunteer to step-aside or face suspension, Magashule instead issued a suspension letter to the President. Magashule issued the letter without any mandate and authorisation of the NEC or the National Working Committee (NWC).

Duarte was addressing the media at the ANC headquarters at Luthuli House, in Johannesburg.
