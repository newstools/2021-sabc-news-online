The  African National Congress (ANC) Interim Provincial Committee (IPC), in the North West, has instructed five party members to step aside. The members based in Tsetse village outside Mahikeng are implicated along with 11 others in serious charges, including attempted murder. One of them is the branch secretary, while the others are senior government officials. Provincial Coordinator for the ANC IPC, Hlomane Chauke, says the five accused have already been served with letters, informing them of the decision. Chauke says, “In terms of the resolution of the conference and guidelines we have already communicated with the five comrades that they need to step aside from the activities of the organisation. So we have communicated with them in terms of Rule 25. 7 that they need to step aside in terms of ANC activities.” SABC Reporter, Patrick Dintwa has more on the story: Comply On Wednesday, the South African Communist Party (SACP) in Limpopo urged all ANC members affected by the step aside resolution to comply. According to the party, only one of eight affected ANC members in Limpopo have heeded the call voluntarily, while others were served with suspension notice. The SACP says the whole country expects them to comply: Ace Magashule Last week, suspended ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule filed court papers challenging the constitutionality of the step aside resolution that resulted in his suspension. All leaders of the governing party who face charges relating to fraud, corruption and money laundering had to step aside from their positions. Magashule refused to do so and was suspended by the ANC NEC.
