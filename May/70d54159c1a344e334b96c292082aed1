Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Member of Parliament, Ringo Madlingozi, says Sports, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa must account for his failure to distribute the COVID-19 grant intended for artists who have been hit hard by the pandemic. Madlingozi criticized Mthethwa at a virtual plenary session during a debate on the Department’s Budget Vote. The EFF has rejected the budget vote that Mthethwa has delivered. Madlingozi says Mthethwa has failed in many respects in his portfolio. “If we are truthful to ourselves; all of us know that the Minister of this portfolio is perhaps the most useless of all ministers in the cabinet. Under his stewardship, almost every single sporting code in this country has gone to the dogs. Our museums including the iconic Robben Island Museums are being run to the ground. Our artists are treated like they have leprosy by the Department and its entities. What is it therefore that Nathi Mthethwa is doing about being the chief condolence sender when artists have died,” says Madlingozi.

Nathi Mthethwa (@NathiMthethwaSA) May 13, 2021  “Minister Mthethwa while you have been getting your fat salary and protected by the police everywhere you go, artists had their houses repossessed. They have had their children thrown out of school. They are struggling to even put a plate on the table, because of the immense impact the coronavirus had had on them,” says Madlingozi.
