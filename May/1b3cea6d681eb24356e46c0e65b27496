Taxi drivers have called off the taxi strike in Nelson Mandela Bay, in the Eastern Cape, after another lengthy meeting with the metro and other stakeholders. The strike started on Tuesday as a result of unpaid COVID-19 relief funds to taxi drivers. The strike affected many businesses, schools as well as health facilities across the metro. The drivers have promised to resume operations on Saturday morning.
