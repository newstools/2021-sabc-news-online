Senior member of the late King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu’s Stakeholder Management, Princess Londiwe Zulu insists that the son of the late Monarch, Simakade Zulu, is the King of the AmaZulu nation. She was speaking during an exclusive interview with SABC News. Princess Zulu is part of the group that opposed the announcement of Prince Misuzulu as successor to the AmaZulu King. She says some senior members of the Royal household unanimously agreed that Prince Simakade Zulu – who was raised by the Regent Queen Mantfombi but is not the son of one of the six Royal wives – is the King of the AmaZulu nation. “I should be saluting to King Smakade. I should not refer to him as Prince. This is because other members of the Royal family nominated him as the King of AmaZulu, and I can stand for it that King Smakade is the King of AmaZulu nation, at this some of AmaZulu Royal family were to openly salute King Smakade in public irrespective of the alleged Court interdict, regardless of the reading of the Regent’s will, as things stand what I was told by some senior members of the Royal family, King Smakade is the rightful heir.” Buthelezi responds Responding to this claim, Traditional Prime Minister to the AmaZulu nation, Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, denies any knowledge that Prince Simakade Zulu wanted to be King. Buthelezi says it is surprising that Prince Simakade did not use the available platforms to express his willingness to be the successor. “This is not running of the president. Each time the new King is installed they will always be other people who will want to claim the throne, so such developments are not something that surprises us at all, but it has been quite a common right through the Zulu nation.” At a media briefing at the royal palace yesterday, Buthelezi confirmed that King Misuzulu kaZwelithini has been put on the throne with full support from the royal family:  Additional reporting by Nonkululeko Hlophe
