Cash-in-transit (CIT) heists are spiking across South Africa yet again. They are taking place almost daily. In recent weeks, there have been several brazen attacks, most of which have happened in Gauteng and the Western Cape. Video: cash-in-transit industry calls for an intensive effort to end heists in South Africa:  Police say they’ve set up a national task team of dedicated detectives to combat the attacks. Fidelity Security Services, Charnel Hattingh, says the industry is concerned. “Currently, Gauteng and the Western Cape are showing the highest increase in cash in transit incidents. Unfortunately, these attacks are orchestrated by very sophisticated syndicates. Our internal investigation teams are currently working with the SAPS (South African Police Service) to combat these CIT heists. The depressed economic situation over the last couple of years and high rate of unemployment has also added to the problem.”
