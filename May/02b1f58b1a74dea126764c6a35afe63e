Chinese current vaccines are effective against the variant first found in India and can quickly cope with new ones, said Shao Yiming, a researcher with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention at a press conference in Beijing on Thursday. Chinese researchers are closely monitoring the situation of new emerging variant first detected in India, conducting research and collecting data, according to Shao. “First, relevant companies and research institutions in our country have carried out some research on the variant first detected in India. The preliminary results show that the current vaccines are effective against the variant first detected in India and can have a certain protective efficacy,” said Shao. Relevant departments and institutions in China are closely following the development of the pandemic, said Shao, adding that the country is able to deal with the emergency caused by the variants. “Second, the virus is getting stronger during the mutation. Once there is a variant that current vaccines are unable to deal with, Chinese inactivated vaccines can quickly cope with it. We only need to add the virus of the new mutant strain to the feeding end, and the whole production process does not to be changed at all. The products are new vaccines for mutated virus. All the departments concerned are closely following the situation and once needed, new vaccines will be available to deal with variant,” said Shao.
