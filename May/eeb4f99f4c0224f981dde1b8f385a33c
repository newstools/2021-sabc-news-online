So, I think the thing is that they are very big. They are a very big category of retail sales – that’s the first thing to note.  I think the second thing to note is that they had exceptionally strong growth for an extended period. So, we do need to see this number from a little bit of a broader perspective. The first being that the areas where the weaknesses are coming from have probably been performing for quite some time. So, some moderation in that regard was probably to be expected.” #CPI inflation hit a 14-month high in April, mainly driven by rising #transport and food prices.
