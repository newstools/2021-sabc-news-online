Residents of flood ravaged houses in the Tshunyane Village near Mahikeng, in the North West, are appealing to local government to fast track relief efforts. Three months after flooding and heavy rains battered 647 homes in February; many families in the North West say they’re still waiting for relief from government. While some have worked to repair their damaged dwellings, others, like 61-year-old Mmemme Mogwase and 64-year-old Matlakala Motsamai continue to live in compromised structures. “There are five of us living in this house and a 10-day-old baby. We are scared that the rains will come back again and damage our houses again. We just want the government to hear our cry. I am speaking here with a broken hear. I am a woman and I am turning 61 on Monday,” says Mogwase. Motsamai adds: “The past rains really damaged my grandchildren’s stuff, including the clinic documents. The house is totally cracked and the shack is also damaged.” Mothibedi Mokhasi, a community leader in the area, says they face a cold winter ahead. “Many houses have been broken down. Until now – the houses have been broken down and we are still looking forward to our government to come and help us. But I am afraid against that there is still another disaster that will come. I am afraid of August because our shacks are not in a good condition,” says Mokhasi. Premier of the North West Province, Job Mokgoro, says all hands are on deck to assist the affected households. “We approached the national department of human settlements to seek permission to repurpose its 2020/21 grant and the director-general agreed that we could use an amount of R35 million. We have made an application to roll over of this amount to ensure successful intervention in dealing with flood-related damages,” Premier Mokgoro adds. R35 million set aside for floods relief in the North West:  The community says it hopes the relief efforts will reach them before the winter chill sets in.
