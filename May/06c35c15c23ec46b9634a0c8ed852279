Police in the Eastern Cape are still hunting for the murderers of three elderly women from Zingqolweni village in Cacadu. The women were murdered on Thursday night. The motive behind the murders is not clear at this stage. Eight people, including a local councillor were recently arrested in connection with the murder of seven people in what is believed to be a vigilante attack in the same area. Police spokesperson Thembinkosi Kinana says the killers of the elderly women will be brought to book along with those involved in the mob justice incidents. “The SAPS was alerted by the members of the community who became suspicious when they did not see the elderly women. As they went to these different homesteads, they found the body of one elderly and together with a one-year-old child who survived the attack. In another homestead, the police found two women. The motives for these killings is not yet known at the moment. We are investigating three murder cases.”
