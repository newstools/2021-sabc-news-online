The number of coronavirus cases has doubled in Gauteng just this week alone. The Gauteng COVID Command Council says while this is worrying, the increases have not yet reached the threshold to be considered a third wave. The Council has been briefing the media in Johannesburg. Council chairperson Dr Mary Kawonga says since Monday this week, the number of COVID-19 cases has doubled and this was very worrying. She says all the districts in Gauteng have seen an increase in cases. However, the Emfuleni region was extremely worrying due to the increasing number of new COVID-19 cases which are approaching a 3rd wave threshold. Family gatherings and school sporting events where people gathered were some of the contributors. Dr Kawonga says this means people are not adhering to COVID-19 protocols. Worrying trend in 4 provinces Meanwhile, the Department of Health has noted a “worrying trend of increasing numbers of detected cases in a number of districts.” This comes at a time when the country is preparing itself for the forecast third wave of the coronavirus. According to the statement released on Thursday evening, while three provinces –  the Free State, Gauteng, Northern Cape and North West  – “are of particular concern”, every province, with the notable exception of Eastern Cape, has at least one district of concern. South Africa recorded 2 149 new COVID-19-related cases on Thursday, taking the cumulative number of cases to 1 590 370. This is the second day in a row the country is recording more than 2 000 cases.
