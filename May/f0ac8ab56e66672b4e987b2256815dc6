Business for South Africa (B4SA) says it’s going all out to urge citizens to take the COVID-19 vaccine. This as the country’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout programme is gathering steam. It’s been a week since the launch of phase 2 of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout – which caters for those who are over 60 years old. The country’s captains of industry, who are overseeing the vaccine rollout programme together with the government, say things are going well so far.
