The DA will be holding its first national rally on Saturday in the run-up to this year’s Local Government Elections in October. It’s titled the “The Time For Change Rally”. The DA says it will the biggest virtual political rally to ever have been held in the country. Thousands of DA members and structures are expected to join online from more than 400 watch parties located across all nine provinces. The rally is the first major political rally ahead of the October 27th polls and leader John Steenhuizen says the DA has a bold vision. “We want to bring change to South Africa’s racialized and polarised society by recommitting ourselves to Nelson Mandela’s dream of a non-racial state, we want to bring change to a country where constitutionalism and the rule of law are under threat and accountability is being totally eroded by politicians who think they are above the law, we want to bring change to our economy that is strangled by state control to exclude the vast majority and include only the connected few.” Meanwhile, the issue of whether there is space for black leaders in the DA and if it can grow its mass appeal has come under the spotlight once again.
