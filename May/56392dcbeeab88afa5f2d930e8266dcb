Tshegofatso Pule’s relatives say they are happy that the case of the alleged mastermind behind her killing, has been transferred to the High Court in Johannesburg for a pre-trial hearing on Friday. Nthuthuko Shoba, appeared briefly in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court, west of Johannesburg, on Tuesday where his case was postponed for the pre-trial hearing. GLD: The Roodepoort Magistrates’ Court has ruled that Ntuthuko Shoba be detained at Jhb prison in a single cell, after he applied to remain in custody at the Krugersdorp Police Station.

Correctional Officer, Mr Lesetja Masenya, explained to the court that sentenced prisoners and awaiting trial detainees are kept at different buildings in Jhb prison.

She was eight months pregnant at the time. “We are happy that finally there is progress with regards to this case. Like I say, we can’t really fault the state much up to this point. They have really done a lot to make sure there was a progress. But it’s the defence that has always caused the delays. But nonetheless at least its  another mile stone for the state and lets wait for Friday to see how the case will go and hopefully the new legal team will be there,” says Pule’s uncle, Tumisang Katake. Shoba is detained in a single cell at the Johannesburg prison. He had applied for this, saying he fears for his life after he became aware of Malephane’s threats to harm him.
