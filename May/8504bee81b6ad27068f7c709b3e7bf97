Former Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) CEO, Lucky Montana, has denied allegations that he bought several properties in Johannesburg and Pretoria using the agency’s money. Montana, who is appearing before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, says he did not receive any properties as a form of gratification or kickback. He has also denied allegations that his former lawyer, Riaan van der Walt, bought the properties on his behalf. “This is false. Siyangena Technologies or Riaan Van der Walt did not purchase any properties for me. There are four properties mentioned – one in Rose Street, Waterkloof in Pretoria, two adjacent properties in Brooklyn and another in Empire road Sandhurst. They were purchased and owned by Precise Trade – a company which Riaan Van der Walt is the sole shareholder and director. I reject, with contempt, (that) these properties belong to me. There were seven properties in my name. I acquired three of the properties before I joined Prasa in 1998.” Montana allegedly bought two houses worth R25 million in Pretoria and Johannesburg. In 2020, the commission’s investigation gave a timeline into the suspicious property purchases Montana made while he was CEO of Prasa. One of the properties is in Pretoria, Waterkloof,  and it was worth R11 million. It is alleged Montana used a shell company named Trade and Invest to purchase the houses through his lawyer Riaan Van der Walt who has since left the country.
