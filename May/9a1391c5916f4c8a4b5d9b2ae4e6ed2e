Former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson, Dudu Myeni, is scheduled to return to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on Tuesday morning. When she appeared before the commission in November last year Myeni repeatedly declined to answer questions even when it came to basic queries around her qualifications, saying that she did not want to incriminate herself. In 2017,  the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) and the SAA Pilots Association brought a case against Myeni to have her declared a delinquent director. Myeni has also failed to appear in court on a number of occasions claiming that she could not afford the cost of transportation as well as legal representatives. Judge Ronel Tolmay ruled that the court will hear three applications in the case against Myeni. The first application relates to amendments of Myeni’s plea, the second is an application for a Joinder, in which Myeni’s legal representatives argue that other directors at SAA should stand trial with her as they also participated in some of the questionable decisions made at SAA. The third application is one for a special plea. Meanwhile, on Monday, a London-based researcher, Paul Holden, testified focusing focus on the flow of cash related to the politically connected Gupta family. The Commission will hear Aviation related testimony from the former Board Chairperson of South African Airways SOC Limited (SAA), Ms Duduzile Myeni, on Tuesday, 25 May 2021 at 09:00. #StateCaptureInquiry pic.twitter.com/3BmUjLtMri — State Capture Commission (@StateCaptureCom) May 24, 2021  Commission hears evidence related to Gupta contracts: Paul Edward Holden Pt2
