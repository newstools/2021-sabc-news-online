The chairperson of the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg, Justice Raymond Zondo says President Cyril Ramaphosa will make another appearance before the Commission at a later date in June. Ramaphosa will appear as President of the country. His previous appearance was as president of the African National Congress (ANC). Ramaphosa was scheduled to give evidence next week but will no longer be doing so. Zondo says he will announce another date in the course of June for when the President will appear. Ramaphosa will be the last witness to give oral evidence at the commission – which is wrapping up before starting work on its report. State Capture Inquiry: 25 May 2021  Last month Ramaphosa appeared before the commission as the president of the ANC. He is also expected to make closing remarks as the State President. On Tuesday, the Commission’s Chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said they had hoped to finalise oral evidence at the end of March, and were working around the clock to make this possible. He said he will make exceptional hearings where possible and will apply to the High Court for a limited extension to finalise the Commission’s report. Zondo said it was important that high-ranking officials in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) where there are serious allegations of corruption and state capture are given the time to complete their evidence. Deputy Chief Justice Zondo said the Commission is mindful of the fact that there are some applications for leave to cross-examine. He suggested that the  Commission can make exceptions and some witnesses may still be called.
