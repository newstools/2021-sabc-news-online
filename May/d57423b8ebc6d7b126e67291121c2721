AmaZulu Traditional Prime Minister, Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi, has described the late Regent of the AmaZulu nation – Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu – as a leader who put the needs of her people first. Queen Mantfombi passed away in a Johannesburg hospital last week. She was interred in a private ceremony at her palace in Nongoma, northern KwaZulu-Natal. Buthelezi was speaking during Friday morning’s memorial service. “She accepted an extraordinary responsibility. Her willingness to accept shows the strength of her character. She always put the Zulu people first. It is devastating that we lost her so suddenly. More devastating still, that we recently laid to rest her husband, our King.” Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi speaks to SABC on the passing of AmaZulu Regent Queen Mantfombi:  People attending the memorial of AmaZulu regent – Queen Mantfombi – wiped tears away together with Princess Bukhosibemvelo Zulu as she recalled the painful illness of both her mother and father – King Goodwill Zwelithini. She says apart from her mother’s own long illness, her condition waned as her father’s condition got better and worse in hospital. King Goodwill Zwelithini passed on from COVID-19 in March. Queen Mantfombi passed away about a month after him. Princess Bukhosibemvelo says it was foolhardy of her to believe that her mother could survive her father.
