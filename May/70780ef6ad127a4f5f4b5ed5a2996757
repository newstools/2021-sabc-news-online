The Eastern Cape Health Department says their COVID-19 tracers are working around the clock to track down any possible contacts to the 14 crew members that tested positive for the coronavirus on a vessel from India. The vessel docked at the Port of Ngqura to transfer the infected crew members off the ship. The ship was en route to Kenya. Provincial Health Department Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo says the infected crew members are now self-isolating at a private facility in Gqeberha. No deaths have been confirmed yet. “Subsequent to that, they were put on isolation first on-board and later on, 10 other crew members who were tested were negative for COVID-19. However, we have ensured that those crew members are put on quarantine to monitor. We have also activated our tracing teams to ensure that the infection does not spread to the community of Gqeberha. The situation seems to be under control,” says Kupelo. 14 crew members on a ship from India test positive for COVID-19: Moshe Motlohi  On Wednesday, South Africa has recorded 2 073 new coronavirus infections.
