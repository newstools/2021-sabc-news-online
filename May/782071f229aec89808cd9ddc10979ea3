The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has raised concerns over delays in reopening the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital after it was gutted by a fire a month ago. The fire started in the storeroom that houses medical supplies and spread to other parts of the hospital. Gauteng Premier David Makhura speaks to journalists outside the hospital in the video below:  DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC Jack Bloom says some patients who were instructed to use nearby hospitals have not yet received medical care due to backlogs. “According to the department, there are sections of the hospital that are structurally safe. I think that is very important to know but they [hospital management] are awaiting a safety certificate from the Jhb city council,” says Bloom. “Meanwhile, I am getting the most terrible calls from patients, particularly cancer patients and people on dialysis who are not being accommodated. People tell me they are trying all the various hotlines and they are not getting help. It is a crisis happening because we are going into a third wave. The problem with the closure of this hospital is that patients are being transferred to other hospitals which are very overcrowded and we need to know what is happening with the hospitals,” explains Bloom.
