Eastern Cape Arts and Recreation MEC, Fezeka Nkomonye, says the Bulhoek Massacre is about educating future generations about the importance of the massacre in the context of land ownership. Nkomonye was giving an address at the Bulhoek massacre centenary commemoration in Ntabelanga in the Eastern Cape on Monday. More than 160 people were shot dead and more than 100 others wounded when the police of the South African Union opened fire on members of the Church of God and Saints of Christ on 24 May 1921. The church followers, known as “Israelites”, were occupying a piece of land in Bulhoek, saying it is a sacred place for worship. Sport, Arts and Culture Minister, Nathi Mthethwa, is expected to give an address at the event. “Today’s programme will be preceded by the laying of a wreath in honour of those that lost their lives in this precinct but also we will be getting an address from the national Minister, honourable Minister Nathi Mthethwa that would be preceded by inputs from the honourable Premier of this province, Oscar Mabuyane,” says Nkomonye. “Today is very important because we are here to write a history and tell our own story. Not on the perspective of the lens of those who oppressed us but tell a story on our own,” explains Nkomonye. Video: 100th Bulhoek massacre commemoration
