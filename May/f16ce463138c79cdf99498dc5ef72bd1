All schools follow and implement strict COVID-19 regulations to limit the spread of this virus. We have seen a consistent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases over the past three weeks, which led to the disruptive opening and closure of schools. Since the 1st of May 2021, 79 schools have been closed to allow for disinfection and the immediate isolation of appropriately identified staff and learners.” Ramaphosa concerned about the surge in COVID-19 cases President Cyril Ramaphosa has raised concerns about the surge of coronavirus cases; especially in the Northern Cape and Free State provinces.

This province has seen a spike in infections during the last few weeks and the hospital admissions tell us that this infection rate is high as the admissions have been rising considerably.
