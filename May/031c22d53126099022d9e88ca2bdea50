The private sector accounts for 56% (6 071 617) of total tests, while the public sector accounts for 44% (4 760 121 ). The country’s recoveries stand at 1 513 202, with a recovery rate of 95%. The number of healthcare workers vaccinated under the Sisonke Protocol currently stands at 381 171. The Gauteng provincial government says it has additional healthcare capacity in anticipation of any surge in COVID-19 cases. Health experts say there’s been an escalation in the number of new COVID-19 cases in Gauteng. The Emfuleni region in Sedibeng on the Vaal is one of the areas that experts are worried about as numbers there are approaching a third wave threshold. The increasing numbers have been blamed on family and religious gatherings and people relaxing their adherence to COVID-19 protocols. Gauteng Premier David Makhura says they have secured additional hospital beds, oxygen and extra healthcare personnel.
