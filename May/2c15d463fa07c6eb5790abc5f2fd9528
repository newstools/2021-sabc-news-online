A section of the M1 north highway in Johannesburg has been closed due to a diesel spill following a crash involving a fuel tanker and five light motor vehicles on Saturday. Traffic is heavily backed up on the highway. No injuries have been reported. Johannesburg Metro Police Spokesperson, Wayne Minnaar, says the diesel tanker is leaking diesel on all the lanes. “There is a major obstruction at the M1 north Oxford offramp due to an accident involving five cars and a tanker. The diesel tanker is now leaking diesel on all the lanes and all the lanes have now been blocked off. Motorists can exit the freeway at Empire Road and get onto Jan Smits Avenue and then Athol Oakland where they can join the M1 north again.” Tanker catches fire in KZN Meanwhile, recovery operations are still underway on the N2 Highway between Mtunzini and Empangeni north of KwaZulu-Natal after a diesel tanker overturned and caught fire.
