The African National Congress (ANC) National Working Committee says letters of suspension will be sent later this week, to party members who are refusing to voluntarily step aside. The decision follows the party’s national working committee meeting on Monday in which lists were collated from different provinces and prepared for this coming weekend’s National Executive Committee meeting. ANC members facing serious crimes including corruption were given 30 days in which to voluntarily step aside or be suspended. ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule is the most senior leader affected as he is facing corruption charges linked to a failed asbestos project during his tenure as premier of the Free State. In a statement, the party says the decision by a member to step aside will be reviewed every six months. Political analyst Sanusha Naidoo says those in public office will pay a heavier price. “There may be those members who are stepping aside who continue to retain the positions they have and so forth. But I think when you are looking at other members like in Parliament and other structures in government, it’s gonna have a different kind of approach. Here is where I think the NEC, in writing those letters, to those affected individuals to step aside and those that are going to be suspended, will really have to unpack of what the implication of the action will be,” says Naidoo.
