Efforts continue by Western Cape Health to register more than 720 000 elderly people as part of the second phase of the vaccine rollout program. Provincial Health Minister Nomafrench Mbombo visited the Durbanville town centre, outside Cape Town on Tuesday, as part of the registration drive. As of midday on Tuesday more than 176 000 elderly people were registered in the Western Cape. Mbombo has stressed the importance of having people 60 years and older vaccinated. “One of the reasons that actually we have paused some of the non-COVID-19 health services is to allow the health system to focus on COVID-19. Most people who ended up overloading our health system are the people who are at high risk. Once the older persons and health workers are vaccinated it means the health system can take a breather and allow bit by bit some of the non-COVID-19 cases that are happening.” WC Health Min.

Some, who preferred not to be named, were however not in favour of being vaccinated, “I have never seen a doctor in my whole entire life, I have never been at the doctor, so that is why it’s only my faith that kept me through every time.” Registration process The second phase of the vaccine rollout program is expected to start on the 17th of this month. Documents required to register include your ID, Passport or Refugee number. Medical Aid number if you have one, a smartphone, tablet or computer. Once successfully registered an SMS will be sent to the number provided and then a second SMS will be sent informing you of when and where you will be vaccinated.
