Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema, says he is shocked that no one from his party has been invited to testify at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. He says EFF Members of Parliament (MPs)  could share their experiences in attempting to hold the executive accountable through parliamentary processes. The opposition party instituted the legal process that eventually led to the Commissioning of the Inquiry into State Capture.  “Because of the efforts of the EFF, which ended up in court demanding that this Commission must be established so that we can continue to hold the corrupt accountable. So it must not be that generally that everyone has failed in that parliament. That’s why we were shocked that we were not called to the State Capture Inquiry because the party that has held the executive accountable, the president accountable, the party that has pushed parliament to do the right thing is the EFF.”
