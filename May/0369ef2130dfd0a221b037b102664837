Gauteng Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo has announced that a decision has been taken to scrap the provincial e-toll system. Opposition parties, civil society and African National Congress in Gauteng have long pressured government to do away with the system, as motorists have refused to pay for it. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula last week announced that a decision by government on the future of the e-toll system is imminent. The e-tolling system was introduced in 2013. Mamabolo says government is waiting for the decision on the scrapping of e-tolls to be formalised. “Even the ministers, in what they have said, they have talked about good news. So imminent good news to us already means we are looking to a completely new e-toll dispensation and we are just waiting for that to be formalised but from where we are we are not turning back on the e-tolls, they are a thing of the past and we are just waiting for that to be formalised and confirmed. They are being scrapped.” He adds: “The people of Gauteng should not be burdened with paying for national roads that serve all of us, neighbouring states and the economy of our country.” Below is the full interview with Mamabolo: The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) has welcomed an announcement by the Gauteng Transport MEC that a decision has been taken to scrap the provincial e-toll system. OUTA’s Chief Executive Wayne Duvenage says, “This is what we have been waiting for and fighting for nine years now and if that is the case we are going to have to celebrate this as a big win for civil society for a very successful civil disobedience campaign that has brought down an unjust law and rightfully so. But if this is the start of that process – in other words, if we are hearing now that somebody is saying that decision has been made by people in authority and it just needs to be formalised – it is excellent news. We are going to celebrate that but we need to hear that from the minister’s mouth.”
