The Hawks have appealed to the public to assist them to find six men suspected of abducting a Post Office Branch Manager in De Aar in the Northern Cape and stealing social grant cards worth R1 million. The suspects forced the Branch Manager to open the post office after hours and stole 500 social security agency cards. Provincial Hawks spokesperson Nomthandazo Mnisi says the suspects approached the Branch Manager at his residence. “It is alleged that in February 2020, six armed unknown suspects approached the Post Office Branch Manager at his residence and demanded office keys. Three of the suspects allegedly drove off with the Branch Manager to the Post Office whilst the other three suspects remained in the house and held the family hostage. The Branch Manager was instructed to open the Post Office and was forced to hand over 500 South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) cards with an estimated value of R1 million.” Closure of 130 Post Offices Meanwhile, the DA says the closure of 130 Post Offices across the country could have serious consequences on social grant recipients.

DA Shadow Social Development Minister Bridget Masango says the party will submit Parliamentary questions to the Departments of Social Development as well as Communications on what contingency plans have been put in place to ensure that the closures do not affect grant recipients.
