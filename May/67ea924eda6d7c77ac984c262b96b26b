British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, on Tuesday, his government would set up an inquiry into the COVID-19 pandemic during this parliamentary session. Johnson addressed the British parliament after Queen Elizabeth presented the House of Lords with Johnson’s plan to “level up” Britain by tackling inequality and driving an economic recovery from the pandemic with a raft of laws. In the 18 months since Johnson’s Conservatives were re-elected with a big parliamentary majority, his agenda has been eclipsed by the pandemic, which caught his government off guard and has absorbed many of its resources for making policy. With Britain’s vaccination programme now far ahead of many other countries and the spread of the virus at low levels, Johnson, 56, is keen to revive his “levelling up” agenda and re-set a premiership also clouded by accusations of cronyism, which he denies. We will deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the United Kingdom stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before  #QueensSpeech pic.twitter.com/mFcKVVoNdK — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) May 11, 2021
