Alleged Cape Town underworld kingpin, Nafiz Modack, has complained of mistreatment. He made the complaint at his appearance in the Bishop Lavis Magistrate’s Court. It is alleged that Modack offered anti-gang unit police officer, Ashley Tabisher, R10 000 and a cellphone in exchange for information that police would carry out operations against him. The pair made a brief appearance in the Bishop Lavis Magistrates’ Court in Cape Town on charges of corruption and money laundering on Monday. The matter which has been transferred to the Blue Down’s Regional Court will be heard on Friday. Modack also faces charges of kidnapping, extortion, conspiracy to commit murder and the attempted murder of Cape Town attorney William Booth. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson, Eric Ntabazalila says, “First, Mr Modack complained about sleeping on a concrete floor and that affected his kidneys and also complained about Halaal food not being served in prison. He wanted his bail application to be done on Monday which was a bit strange because you cannot separate the two bail applications with the same accused.” The video below is reporting that Nafiz Modack case has been transferred to the Blue Downs Regional Court:  Modack and Tabisher are expected to appear with – Zane Killian, Jacques Cronje, and Ricardo Morgan – in the Blue Downs Regional Court on Friday when a date for their bail application is to be set.
