Dozens of East Midlands TVET college students in Makhanda, Eastern Cape, have been left stranded after they were evicted by their private landlords for failing to pay for accommodation. The students have not received their National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) allowances since the start of this academic calendar which resulted in evictions from a private residence. Out in the cold with nowhere to go and no food to eat, they allege that for the past three months they have been paying rent out of their pockets. But the burden is unbearable. “We are here because we have nowhere to go. We have been evicted by our landlords from the houses where we were renting. So now we are here to talk to our campus manager for him to help us with the accommodation,” says a student. “We are facing a problem of NSFAS. We did not get NSFAS the whole semester. The semester is about to end and we have no money. We have to rent each and every month, but we cannot rent because we do not have any money,” says another student.

The institution has committed to assist the students in the best possible way so that they’re safe,” says Students Support Services, Lithemba Busakhwe. Accusations of mismanagement at NSFAS
