The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC)  has ordered Ace Magashule to apologise publicly to members of the party. Last week, after being suspended for failing to step aside in line with the NEC resolution, that members facing criminal charges must volunteer to step aside or face suspension, Magashule instead issued a suspension letter to the President. Magashule issued the letter without any mandate and authorisation of the NEC or the NWC. Reading out the outcomes of their three-day meeting, Ramaphosa says the governing party’s highest decision body has reined in Magashule.
