The Ministry of Transport says there is no decision yet on the future of the e-toll system in Gauteng. This comes after Gauteng Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo said on SAFM on Thursday morning that a decision has been taken to scrap the provincial e-toll system.

Full interview with Mamabolo: Opposition parties, civil society and African National Congress in Gauteng have long pressured government to do away with the system, as motorists have refused to pay for it.
