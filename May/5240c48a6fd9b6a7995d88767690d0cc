The AmaZulu Traditional Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi has disputed allegations that Prince Simakade Zulu has any claim on the AmaZulu throne. Buthelezi was addressing the media in Durban on Tuesday. Allegations around this matter emerged shortly after the late Regent Queen, Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu’s memorial service last week. Her son, Misuzulu kaZwelithini, was named as the successor to the late AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. Buthelezi also read a statement by Prince Simakade Zulu stating that he welcomes the reign of the new Zulu monarch.

King Misuzulu KaZwelithini is the eldest son of the late King Goodwill Zwelithini and Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu.  He is a descendant of the Zulu and IsiSwati Royal families. Misuzulu, loosely translated, means to “unite AmaZulu”. The 46-year-old king is said to be proud of his language isiZulu. In his early education, he was sent to Assembly of God Primary School. In 1985, he was enrolled at Roseland Primary School in Phoenix so he could learn more about the Zulu culture and later St. Michaels School in eSwatini where he is said to have not wanted to learn any other languages except IsiZulu. He later studied International Relations in America. Born in 1974, Zulu’s birth was auspicious as it came a day before Shaka’s Day on September 23 – a day now observed as Heritage Day (24 September) in South Africa.
