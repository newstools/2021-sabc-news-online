Former Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama conceded that he signed a recommendation to the board advocating for T-systems, despite the company coming in second place as the preferred bidder. Gama said he was surprised to learn that Gupta linked entities received a total of R3.5 billion in kickbacks from agreements between Transnet and companies contracted to the parastatal. “There were lots of allegations in terms of different entities and I opened a case at the Hilbrow police station on the 21st of November 2017 to look at all of the allegations that had been levelled especially against entities that were doing business with Transnet. But I think what one had found was that Transnet itself did not appear to have been paying commission to anybody, but that it was entities that were contracted to Transnet that were paying outside people,” said Gama.
