The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc across the world, over 3 million people across the globe have lost their lives to the pandemic. In the past 24-hours, 71 South Africans also succumbed to the virus bringing the total number of deaths to over 54 000. Families who have lost loved ones are battling to pick up the pieces amid the harrowing grief. Virus ripping families apart This Northern Cape family has been left grief-stricken following the death of wife, mother and grandmother. Avril Kadie, 53, was admitted to a hospital in August last year. She tested positive for COVID-19 and within a week tragedy struck leaving her family shattered. Husband Neil Kadie says, “Losing her, my friend – my confidante, my advisor, my nurse, my doctor, my housekeeper, you name it. She was all of that…it’s unbearable, I can’t… I really… I can’t cope without her.” Her children are equally devastated, added Kadie. This past Sunday marked their first Mother’s Day without their beloved mother. They say despite having each other, it’s still not easy. Daughter Nolene Kadie says, “I feel I must be strong for my father and sister. it is very difficult. it feels as if a piece of my heart has been taken away. As if there’s no reason for me to live because my mother was my everything.” Northern Cape sees a spike in COVID-19 cases  Many find solace in the place of worship during trying times, at least one religious leader says there’s been a spike in the numbers of those reaching out for professional help. Crossover Church Kimberley Pastor Chaeslin Trollip says, “This pandemic has put people in isolation, whether it’s based on the fact that we couldn’t go out at level five or whether it’s the fact that all of us are isolated in regards to you getting the disease or the virus yourself and you have to isolate. so based on that we have really seen a heightened sense in regards to people reaching out and saying they want help.” Over the past few months, lockdown regulations have been relaxed – after the economy took a huge blow. But numbers are rising again with the Northern Cape, Free State and North West the main concern. But despite rising numbers and calls for vigilance from authorities, some are still not adhering to regulations. Laboratories around Kimberley have their hands full – as the number of active cases continues to rise. For the Kadie family, death statistics are not just numbers but a daily reality of loss.
