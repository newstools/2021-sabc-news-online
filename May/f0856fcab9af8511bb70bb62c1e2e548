The Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber (NMB) says it is concerned about the impact of the widespread protest in the metro on Tuesday. Thousands of commuters were stranded on Tuesday and the N2 going past the Coega Industrial Development Zone (IDZ) is closed. The Chamber’s acting CEO, Prince Matonsi, says the protests will damage the economy. “While the Business Chamber recognises the right to strike, however, the destruction of and damage to infrastructure is both expensive and regressive. We hope for a swift resolution to the mutual benefit of all parties,” adds Matonsi. EC Protests | Protest action in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro intensifies
