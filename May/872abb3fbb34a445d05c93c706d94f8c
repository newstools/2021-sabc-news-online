Police Minister Bheki Cele has cautioned event organisers who break COVID-19 protocols that they will be held accountable for flouting regulations. Cele was responding to concerns around the large number of people who gathered outside the Pietermaritzburg High Court earlier this week for the corruption trial of former President Jacob Zuma. In the last 24 hours alone, South Africa has recorded 103 deaths and over 4 000 new coronavirus cases. Cele says he is also concerned that people from across the country – from current COVID-19 hotspots like the Free State and Gauteng – travelled to KwaZulu-Natal. “The organisers are supposed to answer because if you organise any form of event you must take on board the laws of the land. If not you have to answer, maybe it’s enough to say so. He adds, “You saw what happened in Pietermaritzburg people not having masks and all that I think we need to contribute by asking what the story but also urging the organisers of those events to respect the laws of the land.” Reaction to increasing COVID-19 infections: Prof. Abdool Karim  INFOGRAPHIC: Latest COVID-19 cases in South Africa  SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 339 376 197 462 65 086 81 806 11 657 2 430 1 ﻿438 DEATHS 4 280 11 141 10 500 1 ﻿889 1 ﻿046 86163 450 377 74 706 49 046 292 601  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 99 517 27 MAY 2021 1 649 977 56 170 11 495 627 1 548 092 4 424 93 Vaccination Phase 2 348 426 11 789 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
