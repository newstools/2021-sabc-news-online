The estranged wife of former cabinet minister Malusi Gigaba has denied that she was bought by a clique in the African National Congress (ANC) to destroy her husband’s political career. She has resumed her testimony at the State Capture Commission on Friday morning after it was halted on Thursday night due to security concerns. Malusi Gigaba has claimed in an earlier affidavit that his wife was working with certain individuals to taint in his name in the media. According to Norma Gigaba, her husband told her that people were pushing President Cyril Ramaphosa for his resignation. Noma also told the commission that her estranged husband asked the Guptas for assistance to clear the debts of a relative who was owning R850 000. The relative was later employed at the Guptas’ company Sahara computers. Malusi Gigaba is expected to appear later on Friday. Below is the live stream for Friday’s proceedings:  ‘Guptas paid for Mauritius trip’ Noma has told the State Capture Commission how her husband destroyed evidence of a trip to Mauritius paid for by the Guptas. Noma Gigaba says this was meant to conceal the trip from the commission, adding that the former minister took her passport and deleted all pictures of their trip. In his affidavit, Malusi Gigaba denied that the Guptas paid for his trip to Mauritius.
