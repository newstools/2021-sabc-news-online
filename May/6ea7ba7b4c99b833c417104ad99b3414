Elderly residents at an Old Age Home in Mahikeng in North West are waiting with bated breath for the highly anticipated vaccinations of people over 60 years of age. Phase 2 of the national coronavirus vaccination programme got underway on Monday morning. North West sites at Moses Kotane, Rustenburg, Brits, Potchefstroom and Klerksdorp start today. Vaccination in Mahikeng and four other areas is expected to commence tomorrow. The Department of Health says close to 60 000 people over the age of 60 have registered for vaccinations across the province. Gretchen Smith, a resident at the Rotarus Old Age Home in Mahikeng, says they are waiting in anticipation. “We waited a long time for this. With the numbers increasing day by day and the situation in India, I am very concerned. So I am not negative at all and to all those negative people I want to say that god has given those people the knowledge.” Elize Botha, manager at the Rotarus Old Age Home, says general staff members have been left out for now. “We just feel that the health of the residents and staff working here is of paramount importance because we are working closely together. So, it’s really important that all the staff that is working here, I mean the people who are arranging the food doing the dishes, helping to make the beds…to be vaccinated.
