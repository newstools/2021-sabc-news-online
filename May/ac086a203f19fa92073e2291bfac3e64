Western Cape police have revealed that they seized illegal drugs last week valued at about R13 million in three major busts in two days. Spokesperson Novela Potelwa says in total six suspects were arrested and some of them have already appeared in court. Potelwa says police on Tuesday last week intercepted large quantities of heroin, crystal meth and cocaine valued at R5.4  million on the West Coast town of Vredendal. On Wednesday police raided two storage facilities at Westlake and Noordhoek where they seized 30 000 mandrax tablets and crystal meth. Potelwa says there was a third bust for dagga also on Wednesday. “Lockdown II forces descended on residence in Windsor, Kraaifontein where a dagga cultivating lab with dagga products were seized. The value of the seizure is estimated at is R5.4 million. Police believe the seizures will go a long way in efforts to rid Western Cape communities of drugs.”
