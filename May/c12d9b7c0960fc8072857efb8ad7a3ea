As confusion reigns over the fate of the e-tolls, the national Transport Department says it is the only one mandated to announce Cabinet’s decision on whether they should be scrapped or not. This comes after Gauteng Transport and Roads Infrastructure MEC Jacob Mamabolo told the SABC that the e-tolls had been scrapped. Full interview with Mamabolo: He later claimed that he had been misquoted. Mamabolo said he had made it clear that although the provincial government was opposed to e-tolls, it was not true that they had been scrapped. Mamabolo maintained that he had been engaging in consultations with Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula since November 2020 on the provincial government’s rejection of the proposed implementation of Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act regulations as another method of enforcing the e-tolling system. Mamabolo’s statement: Mbalula’s spokesperson Ayanda Allie-Paine says no decision has been made on whether to scrap the e-tolls or not but consultations are continuing. “Everybody involved here can agree that it has taken longer than anticipated, much longer than desired as well, the reason being that there are intensive consultations. Remember the initial problem was that we were caught up in the euphoria of 2010 FIFA World Cup.” NO DECISION YET ON THE FUTURE OF THE ETOLLS We are of the view that the MEC has made it quite clear that what he articulated during the interview, is a provincial position of Gauteng, which is not a new matter at all. pic.twitter.com/5j1Qwl8kWL — |Mr Fix (@MbalulaFikile) May 27, 2021
