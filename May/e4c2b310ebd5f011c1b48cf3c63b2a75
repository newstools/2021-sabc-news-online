The alleged mastermind behind the murder of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule has been denied bail by the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court, west of Johannesburg. Police had arrested 32-year-old Nthuthuko Shoba at his home in Florida earlier this year, after the man convicted of  Pule’s murder, entered into a plea agreement with the state to testify against Shoba. In June last year, Pule’s body was found in an open veld in Roodepoort. She was eight months pregnant at the time. Nthuthuko Shoba will have to remain behind bars until the conclusion of his case, after being denied bail by Magistrate Delize Smith. In handing down her ruling, Magistrate Smith said that Shoba never submitted any compelling circumstances to be released on bail. “The applicant has placed nothing compelling before this court when taking into account the new evidence not known previously and the elaboration already on the known facts that exceptional circumstances do exist why would it be in the interest of justice that he be submitted to bail. Bail is refused.” He appeared in the dock wearing a black suit and black face mask, whilst looking straight ahead at the Magistrate, while she handed down her ruling. The Pule family has welcomed the ruling, denying Shoba bail. Family spokesperson Botlhale Modisane says it is a small victory. “We are absolutely happy about the judgement we got today. It’s a small victory because bigger things are yet to come, but it’s one worth celebrating non the less. Our hope has been restored in the judicial system and it continues to be restored. You know that the fact that this is the second time he has been denied bail so we are absolutely happy and we just need to prepare going forward for what is still to come.” The case has been postponed to the 17th of May for further investigations.
