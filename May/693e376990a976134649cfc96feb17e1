National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole says there is a national priority list to build new police stations across the country. Sitole was responding to members of the National Council of Province’s Select Committee on Security and Justice, during a virtual briefing by the Department on its budget and annual performance plans on Wednesday. Some members of parliament raised concerns in the committee about the incompleteness of some police stations in the North West. Sitole said, “There is a national priority list of police stations that need to be built which cuts across all provinces. And when we build police stations according to community needs, that is across those provinces and then we build them according to that particular priority list…” “The stations, which we have referred to, are stations which were already constructed but were not finished. And as a result of either legal issues or failure of the contractors to perform their duties, that’s where we are saying three of those are in the North West. But those are not necessarily newly built police stations. I think for newly built police stations, both North West and other provinces have got stations on the particular list,” added Sitole.
