Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has told Parliament that plans are at an advanced stage for the standardisation of assessments for grades three, six, and nine. This will be accompanied by the introduction of a general education certificate before grade nine. Speaking during her department’s budget vote debate on Thursday, Motshekga said this is being done to avoid pupils only encountering a standardised exam at grade 12. “We have already produced the policy for the general education and Umalusi is in the process of evaluating it. We will be gazetting it and invite comments on the GEC certificate and it will be piloted or it will be implemented quite soon. And we will keep the house updated.” Devastating effect of  COVID-19 The Minister also told Parliament that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on the sector. Motshekga said in addition to the loss of teaching and learning time, the department has also had to endure budget cuts. “Between last year and up to Feb 2021 we lost about 1678 educators. We unfortunately in the sector lost the MEC for education in NC, lost the superintend General of education in the EC, we lost the president of NATU and they all succumbed to covid19 We continue to say may their souls rest in peace.” Basic Education Budget:
