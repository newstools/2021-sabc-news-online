The head of the Special Investigating Unit Advocate Andy Mothibi says the investigation into allegations of corruption in the Health Ministry is about to be concluded. Mothibi says they have already reached some conclusions on aspects of the investigations, but cannot disclose these at this stage. Speaking during the launch of the Infrastructure Built Anti-Corruption Forum alongside Minister for Public Works and Infrastructure Development Patricia De Lille, Mothibi says they hope to conclude the investigation by the end of June. He says this is part of the broader investigations into PPE procurement, which they hope to complete by the end of August. “Where there is a need for consequence management in the department, we will refer those to the DG. Where there’s a need for prosecution our law requires us to send it to the NPA and where there’s a need for any action against anyone at any level, including the executive authority, we will do so.” SIU Spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago says the unit is probing an R82 million Health Department tender involving people close to Dr Zweli Mkhize:  DA Shadow Health Minister, Siviwe Gwarube, has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to act on Mkhize following reports that a network of his friends and family allegedly benefitted from a dodgy multi-million rand contract. Gwarube has also called for the expansion of an investigation by the SIU into reports that Mkhize is implicated in an improperly awarded contract by his department to Digital Vibes, a company run by his close associates. Reports say the contract cost the State R150 million. Gwarube says they are concerned that Digital Vibes was seemingly contracted in part to do work that should have been done by the department, or at the very least submitted invoices for such work.
