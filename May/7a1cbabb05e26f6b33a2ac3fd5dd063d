A vaccination drive-thru has been set up to fast-track the country’s second phase vaccination rollout. The Gauteng Provincial Government has increased the number of vaccination sites from 28 to 63 in the province’s five regions. This will ensure that more people over the age of 60 years and older receive the two-dose Pfizer vaccine. Primary Healthcare worker, Sithiba Matheza, says the drive-thru vaccination site is a first of its kind. Despite some teething problems, it was off to a good start since it went operational on Monday. “We can say the people are appreciating this project, we are still having a little bit of challenges. The first challenge is with the IT, the routers, the tablets we don’t have network. We as nurses are not trained with IT issues we take care of the sick. But now you have to do the gadget thing as well and also give an injection,” says Matheza. Ekurhuleni Health District Manager, Mbangiseni Magoro, says the drive-thru vaccination site is a way of adding more sites to reach as many people as possible. “This facility that we are in is quite large, It has three entrances, and we are only using one at the moment. We will expand and open two more entrances so we can vaccinate more people. So that we can be able to reach capacity of 1 200 vaccinations per day in this facility, that is the plan,” explains Magoro. While some were happy to finally get their shots, others were frustrated by the delays caused by the technical glitches. “We sitting here for two hours already and that’s a little bit long, what about all these tents standing here doing nothing. I am not very happy with it,” said one elderly.
