Political analyst Ralph Mathekga says suspended African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, is likely buying time – by approaching the courts – to mobilise the party’s branches against the recent decisions made by the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC). Magashule has served Luthuli House with court papers challenging the constitutionality of the party’s step-aside resolution that has resulted in his suspension.

The ANC is no longer an implementer, the ANC is now a party that has to respond to the way in which this policy has been formulated and so forth. It does buy him time to be in the political wonderland,” says Mathekga. ” If that buys him time while the court is processing, that gives him time to play politics with the branches around this thing,” says Mathekga. Mathekga says for Magashule, it is all about escalating the matter to the branches. “He seems to believe that the branches will have a different view to the way the ANC and the NEC has presided thus far,” says Mathekga.
