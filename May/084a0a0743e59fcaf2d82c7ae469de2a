Nigeria’s army chief, who died along with ten others in a plane crash, has been buried in the capital, Abuja. The plane carrying Ibrahim Attahiru and other senior military officers crashed in the country’s north western state of Kaduna. The Nigerian Army Chief and his entourage were in Kaduna state to commission new recruits into the force when the crash occurred. The nation’s armed forces attribute the crash to bad weather. The Chief of Defence Staff in Nigeria has ordered the constitution of an accident investigation board to probe further the cause of the mishap. President Muhammadu Buhari has described the crash as a blow to the country. He says it comes at a time when armed forces are determined to win the war against insurgents. Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru was appointed Nigeria’s 21st Chief of Army Staff in January this year. He previously held several military appointments in the country and abroad.
