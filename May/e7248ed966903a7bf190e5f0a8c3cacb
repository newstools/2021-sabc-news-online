The family members of a 32-year-old woman from Seshego, near Polokwane, in Limpopo, who was killed allegedly by her boyfriend, say they are still traumatised. Tshepo Rakoma was shot and killed at a parking lot while sitting in her car last week. Rakoma’s body had multiple gunshot wounds. The police have arrested a 34-year-old suspect who was apprehended after attempting to commit suicide by threatening to jump off a building. Family spokesperson Tebogo Pila says they are struggling to come to terms with the death of their loved one. “We are very sad, we are broken, we are shattered. We don’t know how we are feeling. No one has been in their normal senses, especially my mother who now has to take care of the orphaned three kids. We don’t even know to explain how we feel…” GBV scourge South Africa is dealing with the social ill of gender-based violence. Last week, the small community of Kirkwood in the Eastern Cape was left still reeling in shock after a spate of gender-based violence cases that claimed the lives of two women.
