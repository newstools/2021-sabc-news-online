The family of a 35-year-old woman from Lenyenye in Limpopo, who died after her boyfriend allegedly doused her with petrol and set her alight, say they are heartbroken. Lindiwe Mogale from Tickyline village was allegedly attacked by the suspect following an argument on the 6th of May. Mogale succumbed to her injuries on Friday last week. Lindiwe Mogale’s murder sent shockwaves to the community. She succumbed to third degree burn wounds at Mankweng Hospital. The family says the couple had a series of arguments before her death. Mogale was allegedly doused with petrol by her boyfriend and suspect, Matome Modiba, after an argument. Her uncle Maile Mogale says they are devastated. “The manner in which she died, from being doused with petrol is unusual, the boyfriend should have walked away from the relationship without killing her. The two were together for a while but they should have ended the relationship, Lindiwe loved people, she was always laughing.” The suspect made an appearance at the Magistrate’s Court on murder charges and arson. Police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo says the suspect will apply for bail on the 28th of May. “A thirty-year-old man Matome Modiba who was arrested for allegedly killing a woman by setting her alight appeared in Naphuno Magistrate’s Court on charges of murder and arson. He was remanded in custody until Friday the 28th of May for bail application and further police investigations.” Mogale will be buried on Saturday at Lenyenye. Investigations into the murder and arson case are continuing.
