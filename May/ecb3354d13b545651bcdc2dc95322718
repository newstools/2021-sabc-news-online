Trade union federation, Cosatu, has confirmed that government has come back with a revised wage offer to government employees. There are no details so far as unions and government are still locked in a meeting, engaging on the new proposed wage agreement. Last week, government requested time out to go and consider a number of proposals that had been made by independent economists. Mugwena Maluleke is the convener for all Cosatu-affiliated public service unions in the Public Service Coordinating Bargaining Council. He says: “The employer has tabled a revised offer to the council. However, the process of engagement is ongoing and therefore the details shall only be made available once the council General Secretary has released a draft of a formal offer, at the moment we are still engaging.” Government began the negotiations with a zero percent increase offer, while the unions have been demanding a 7% wage hike. They dismissed the zero percent increase as a slap in the face, especially to healthcare workers who have been at the fore front of the battle against COVID-19. More on the revised offer in the video below:  Trade union, Public Servants Association of South Africa, had declared a dispute at the CCMA. While other unions also affiliated to its umbrella body, Fedusa, had resolved to wait for a 10-day facilitation period to run its course before charting the way forward.
