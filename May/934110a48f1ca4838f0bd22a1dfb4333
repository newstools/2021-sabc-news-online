Suspended African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Ace Magashule has alleged that state organs, like the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), are being used in factional battles. Magashule is insisting he will not step aside because, he claims, he has not done anything wrong. There’s a growing power struggle in the ANC as Magashule refuses to comply with the terms of his suspension after being charged with corruption. Unfiltered: ANC step-aside resolution:  Magashule has denied the charges and calls the move unconstitutional. Instead, he, as head of the ANC, has suspended president Cyril Ramaphosa. During an exclusive interview with SABC News, on Friday, Magashule says, “I have not done anything wrong. There are no processes that were followed and I was elected by members of the ANC at the conference. Read the resolutions of Nasrec in terms of all those roles I have to play. Of course, it is designed to remove me.” Magashule has rejected the possibility of him being expelled from the ANC at a key NEC meeting this weekend, saying he “can’t be banned.” He has alleged that no legal processes have been followed by the NEC in his suspension and that the top leadership of the governing party should rather have exhausted internal processes in dealing with differences.
