The  African National Congress (ANC) in the Northern Cape says it is ready to challenge Wednesday’s court case brought by its own members. Some ANC members filed an urgent application in the High Court in Johannesburg in a bid to halt the Northern Cape provincial conference next week. Their court application further seeks to declare the Frances Baard Regional conference, held some two weeks ago, unconstitutional. The disgruntled ANC members allege that there is manipulation of membership numbers and misrepresentation of branches in the Northern Cape. ANC Provincial Secretary, Deshi Ngxanga is confident that they will win the case. “We have responded basically to all disputes as the provincial disputes committee. We are surprised that some comrades decided to elevate it now to the court of laws. But we as the province, are ready for that and we believe we have a strong case. Our case is winnable. We will contest that very strongly. So we are ready for any eventuality.” The party needs to restore its damaged image: Zamani Saul  Angry members have been disrupting Biennal Branch General Meetings which have some cases turned violent. In recent months, disgruntled ANC members allegedly stoned the Upington home of party provincial secretary Deshi Ngxanga and damaged his car tyres. In another incident, party members also allegedly attacked the home of a regional chairperson.
