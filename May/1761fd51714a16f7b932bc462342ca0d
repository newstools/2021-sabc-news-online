The suspended Mangaung Metro municipal manager Tankiso Mea is expected to challenge his suspension at the Free State High Court in Bloemfontein. Mea’s suspension came after calls from the Democratic Alliance for his suspension pending the investigation into misconduct and maladministration. The call was also made by residents who shut down services in Bloemfontein last week calling for the dissolution of the council. The Mangaung Metro was placed under administration in December 2019 and has been downgraded twice by Moody’s rating agency. During the protests, shutdown organiser Themba Zweni said that residents have been subjected to poor service delivery for a long time. Allegations against Mea include financial mismanagement, unauthorised and wasteful expenditure, as outlined in the video below: VIDEO: In May, residents of Bloemfontein protested against poor service delivery, nepotism:
