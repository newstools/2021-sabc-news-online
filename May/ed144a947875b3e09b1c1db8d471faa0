The anti-gang unit member accused of corruption alongside alleged gang boss, Nafiz Modack, wants his bail application to be heard separately from his co-accused. Ashley Tabisher is accused of accepting money from Modack in exchange for information on when police would raid his premises. The pair appeared alongside Zane Killian, Jacques Cronje and Ricardo Morgan in the Blue Downs Regional Court. Charges against them range from extortion and racketeering to the murder of anti-gang unit member, Charl Kinnear. As defence lawyers press ahead in their bid for more information from the state in order to prepare for bail, Tabisher’s counsel says he has been ready since his arrest on May 4. He says the anti-gang unit sergeant is still employed by the police, has no previous convictions and that delaying his right to apply for bail, is an abortion of justice. Lawyers for Modack, Killian and Cronje are, however, requesting particulars from the prosecution. The state says only a full-blown interlocutory application will determine what information it should share with the defence at this stage. “Our advocate Greg Wolmarans said no this is not how you do things, you cannot give something to us in the passages of the court and expect us to respond, this does not only affect us as the NPA it also affects the investigators which we need to consult to determine what other information we can give to the defence determine how that information is likely to compromise the case and how its likely to impact charges that we are likely to add at a later stage,” says NPA Western Cape Spokesperson,  Eric Ntabazalila. The matter has been postponed to June 9.
