Members of Zulu regiments, maidens and women in traditional attire have gathered at the Kwakhangelamankhengane royal palace where the remains of the late regent, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu, have arrived. The Queen’s remains were transported by road from Johannesburg to Nongoma to be interred at her palace. Her Majesty hailed as a mother:  People lined the road and sang to express their grief. The hearse was met by dignitaries, including senior members of the royal family and Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Doctor Nomagugu Ngobese, leader of the Nomkhubulwane cultural group, says the AmaZulu nation should seek spiritual guidance about the double blow of the passing of both King Goodwill Zwelitini  kaBhekuzulu and Queen Mantfombi. ” We as Zulu people I think something must be done, prayers in the mountains to culminate and ask to reprimand us. Maybe we are sinners of course. Each and every one of us. So this is umshopi, umshopi.” Makhura wishes royal house strength Earlier, Gauteng Premier David Makhura called on members of the AmaZulu royal family to be resilient in light of the death of the regent of the AmaZulu nation, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu. The Queen died in the Milpark hospital in Johannesburg on Thursday last week at the age of 65. The Queen will be buried at the Kwakhangelamankengane Palace in Nongoma on Thursday. Makhura says the AmaZulu nation should remain strong. “It is indeed sad that we have lost the Queen regent –  her majesty-immediately after losing the King. But I think as I say all as a people is to do is to wish the Zulu royal house strength and resilience and we are hoping that they will be able to pull through in these difficult times,” says Makhura.
