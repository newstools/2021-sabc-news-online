The 50-year-old Mbilwi Secondary School teacher accused of raping a 17-year-old learner outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo, has resigned. The accused, Solomon Makhuvha, who is still in custody for the alleged offence, has tendered his resignation to the Education Department. Makhuvha allegedly raped the learner from the same school in 2018. Limpopo Education Department spokesperson Tidimalo Chuene says they have accepted the teacher’s resignation. “His resignation was accepted and processed accordingly. He has since been terminated from our system. We deem accusations against him serious and worrying.” Chuene says they want the law to take its course. The accused teacher is expected to apply for bail in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. He has been remanded in custody. Discussion on the psychological and physical impact of rape:
