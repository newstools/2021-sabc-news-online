The Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac) says they believe that former President Jacob Zuma could be looking to be acquitted of all charges, through his special plea seeking the recusal of lead State prosecutor, Advocate Billy Downer. Zuma and French arms company, Thales, are back in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Wednesday to face fraud, corruption, racketeering and money laundering charges. Casac’s Executive Secretary Lawson Naidoo says he expects a lengthy trial with over 200 witnesses due to testify. Naidoo says, “The only issue here they will have to deal with is the application for Mr Downer’s recusal formal application in terms of his lack of title to prosecute but it’s really tantamount to the same thing, wanting his recusal from the case and therefore for the court to announce a verdict on the acquittal of Mr Zuma which will flow from that. The second plea, which is that of not guilty which we expect Mr Zuma to file would mean that the trial would commence and evidence would be led.” “Zuma remains the heart of the ANC” Political Analyst Xolani Dube says Zuma remains the heart of the African National Congress (ANC), despite the court battle that he is facing. Dube says Zuma still has a lot of influence in the ANC. He says, “Even post his term, he still remains the magnet. I can say to a certain extent he is still the heart of the ANC. It was not by mistake that everything that happens around the fall of the ANC, JZ was supposed to be at the centre.” VIDEO: Below is the full interview with Dube: Some ANC leaders including the suspended Secretary-General Ace Magashule and the suspended former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo attended the last week’s court proceedings.
