The ANC Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) in the North West says only four of its five members who requested to step aside, have done so. These are members implicated in various criminal activities.

Coordinator for the ANC IPC, Hlomane Chauke, says the only member who is refusing to step aside is the speaker of Mahikeng local municipality, Bafana Nebe. “In the North West with regards to the issue of step aside we had five comrades whom we have identified. Four of them have already stepped aside. We are left with one comrade who we have already in fact communicated with him formally to inform him that he needed to do that and that happens to be the speaker of a Mahikeng local municipality by the name of comrade Nebe. It seems that the comrade is not adhering to what supposed to have happened.” Chauke says they are now going to suspend Nebe’s membership as it’s clear that he is defying their call. “What is going to happen obviously will be for us to ignite the disciplinary process, clearly is that the comrade is not ready and I think he is not even willing. Then we will have to implement the Constitution of the ANC and suspend the membership.” Meanwhile, ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa says the NEC will deal with his so-called letter of “suspension” at its meeting this weekend.
