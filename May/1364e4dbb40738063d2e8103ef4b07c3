We need time to do what needs to be done ahead of learners returning but also to align to the calendar so that when schools close we all prepare for the full return of primary schools on the 26 of July 2021, the high schools will come later.” “There is an intention to return them as well but the science right now does indicate that the risk is much higher with older children that is why we are starting with primary school children,” added Mhlanga.
