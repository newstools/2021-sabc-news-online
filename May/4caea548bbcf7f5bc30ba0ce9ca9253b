The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) has released a number for a toll-free line that South Africans who have relatives in Gaza can call to establish whether their loved ones are safe or not. The number is 012 351 1000. There have been more Israeli airstrikes on targets in Gaza. Hamas militants have also continued to fire more rockets at cities in southern Israel. Health officials in Gaza say nearly 150 people have died in a week of fighting. The department’s Director-General responsible for the Middle East, Anil Sooklal says, “The toll-free line is there to assist South Africans that may want to get in contact with relatives, friends or family that are in Palestine. It is there to try and make contact with the relatives and friends through our office Ramallah as there is a great deal of concern by South Africans in terms of the catastrophe that is unfolding especially in Gaza due to the unwarranted attacks by the Israeli defence forces on the Palestinians.” There have been more Israeli airstrikes on targets in Gaza, with one hitting the Hamas chief in the territory Yahya al-Sinwar. In response, Hamas fired more rockets at cities in southern Israel. Meanwhile, thousands of protesters in a number of European cities marched in support of Palestine as the worst violence in years rages on between Israel and Palestine in the Gaza Strip. SABC foreign editor, Sophie Mokoena gives an update:  This week, South Africa called on all countries in the Middle East to respond positively to the Arab League’s foreign ministers’ plan to immediately convene an emergency meeting aimed at mediation. South Africa therefore strongly condemns the unjust attacks by Israel on Palestinian civilians and calls on Israel to immediately stop all its hostilities and comply with international law.
