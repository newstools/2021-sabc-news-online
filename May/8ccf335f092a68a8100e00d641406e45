A fire which broke out at a warehouse in Fordsburg, Johannesburg last night, has been contained. The flames ravaged several floors of the warehouse. However, no injuries or fatalities were reported. Johannesburg Emergency Services officials were still on scene in the early hours of Sunday morning to ensure the fire doesn’t spread to adjacent flats. “On arrival we found the warehouse well alight. We had managed to contain the fire until later when it spread to other floors. At this moment, we have four fire engines around the building just to ensure that it does not spread to the residential areas that are around. We had one incident were a window broke because of the heat that was at a nearby flat. No injuries or fatalities have been reported. The fire has been contained,” says Johannesburg Emergency Services Spokesperson, Nana Radebe. The cause of the inferno is being investigated.
