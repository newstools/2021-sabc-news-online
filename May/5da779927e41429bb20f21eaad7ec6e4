California will offer $116.5 million in cash and gift cards to residents who get COVID-19 vaccinations before June 15, the latest – and most lucrative – incentive by US states desperate to persuade laggards and vaccine-skeptics to get the injection. The move by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom is part of an effort to boost vaccinations as the state prepares to fully reopen its economy on June 15. Ten Californians who become inoculated before that date stand to win lottery-style prizes of $1.5 million a piece, while another 30 people will each win $50,000. The incentives are being offered as Newsom is fighting off a recall campaign that has become a cause celebre among Republicans nationwide. It is one of many ways that Newsom plans to spend an unprecedented state budget surplus. Across the United States, states and private organisations have offered incentives to persuade people to become inoculated against COVID-19, which has killed nearly 3.7 million people worldwide. The incentives range from free baseball tickets and beer, to college scholarships and cash.
