Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula will on Friday outline steps taken to professionalise the taxi industry when MPs debate his department’s budget vote in Parliament. It is also an opportunity to outline and update South Africans on big road infrastructure projects and plans already in place to fix department entities and strengthen traffic law enforcement. The bulk of Parliament’s work this week has been spent on debating the budget votes of various departments. Discussions to reform the country’s taxi industry kicked off in 2020 when Mbalula officially launched the National Taxi Lekgotla Public Discourse Platform, in Germiston. The Lekgotla rolled out a series of engagements between industry players, stakeholders, businesses and civil society towards formalisation of the taxi industry. Government has pledged its support for the sector and is expected to subsidise the industry this year to ensure increased safety and convenience for commuters. Tomorrow, I will reflect on the strides we have taken to tackle the pressing challenges in the transport sector. This includes unpacking our plans towards economic recovery and accelerating transformation of the taxi industry. pic.twitter.com/W1qK7TS2mb — |Mr Fix (@MbalulaFikile) May 20, 2021  Transport Department on a drive to reshape SA’s taxi industry
