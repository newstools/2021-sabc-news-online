“I am 60-years-old and drive a taxi. I am happy that we are getting a chance to be vaccinated,” says one resident. “I will take the vaccine. I told my children to register me and I am willing to go and get vaccinated,” says another resident. “I don’t have any hesitation about the vaccine. I’m just waiting for them to come and register me at home because when they arrived I was not at home,” says another resident. The first phase of the rollout experienced delays due to the unavailability of stock and the temporary suspension of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. The target for Phase 1 was to vaccinate over 270 000 healthcare workers in the province. However, KwaZulu-Natal has only vaccinated 70 000 healthcare workers so far. However, even in the buzzing Durban city centre, there are elderly people who are not in old age homes, who have not registered yet or don’t know how to register. Rumours of possible side effects still scare some people off from being vaccinated. One elderly woman from the Ntshawini area at KwaDukuza is afraid of the vaccine. “I’m afraid that I might die early before my time because of COVID-19. But I will not get COVID, because I live alone and I’m active in my house and around my garden. I’m scared of getting the vaccine because it might be the thing that gives me COVID if I get that injection.” The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health made the Royal Showground a mass vaccination centre in Pietermaritzburg.
