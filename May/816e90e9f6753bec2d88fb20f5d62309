Leader of Action SA Herman Mashaba has announced that he will run for the City of Johannesburg mayoral position in the October local government elections. South Africans will be going to the polls for the local government elections in October. Mashaba vacated the position in October 2019 when he quit the Democratic Alliance in protest over the election of Helen Zille as Federal Chairperson of the party. Mashaba, who had held the position for three years, has asked Johannesburg residents to allow him to serve them again. “Today I am putting my name forward to serve you the residents of Joburg once more and once you give me the mandate I will resume the work of bringing real change to the people of Johannesburg. To the residents of Johannesburg, I would like to ask you that if you have my vision for the city please endorse me as your mayoral candidate by visiting MashabaForMayor.co.za” Today I am putting my name forward to serve the residents of Johannesburg once more. And once you give me the mandate, I will resume the work of bringing real changes – or Diphetogo – to the people of Joburg.#MashabaForMayor  pic.twitter.com/4HnWtOCDyH — Herman Mashaba (@HermanMashaba) May 20, 2021  Please join me from 10h00 for an important announcement.
