Former Cabinet Minister, Malusi Gigaba and his estranged wife Nomachule will both be appearing before the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of  State Capture on Friday after proceedings were adjourned on Thursday night due to security concerns. Chair Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo didn’t reveal the details of the security concerns before he stopped Nomachule Gigaba’s testimony and asked her to come back in the morning. It was her second appearance before the commission. During her testimony, she said her husband was very angry when he was moved from Public Enterprises to Home Affairs. She says pressure from Ajay Gupta and Dudu Myeni got him demoted. “I remember when he came back at home after he was told that he’s going to be taken back to Home affairs and no longer a minister of DPE. He was so angry and I said what happened what did they say, I thought he was fired the way he was so devastated. Then he said no, they are taking me back to home affairs just because of Dudu Myeni and the Guptas.” Video: Nomachule Gigaba testifies at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture  Malusi could not say “no” to Ajay Gupta Gigaba said her husband would go to the Gupta compound, even when he didn’t want to. She also revealed that Malusi could not say ‘no’ to Ajay Gupta, who constantly called to make demands. She further stated that the interference of the Guptas gave Malusi migraines which affected him badly. “It was very stressful on him and the stress gave him migraines, a lot of them, where he had to go to Rosebank hospital to take injections. So, he didn’t have control of his work. He wanted to do his work, but he could not disagree with them. I even asked him why you don’t tell them you don’t want it. He said he can’t.”
