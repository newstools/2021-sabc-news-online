All eyes are on Saturday’s public sector wage talks. Government is expected to table a new offer that will defuse the current impasse at the Public Sector Coordinating Bargaining Council. Organised labour is challenging government’s stance to implement a zero percent wage hike, along with wage freeze for the next three years. The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) says options put forward by the economists are still under consideration. However, some unions affiliated to Fedusa, such as the Public Servants Association, have pulled out of talks, opting to declare a dispute. The PSA’s move came after the collapse of the talks on April 23 after the parties could not find each other. Fedusa says its other affiliated public sector unions remain united in their resolve to find an amicable solution to the current impasse. But should the facilitation process produce no results, they will be left with no other option but to also declare a dispute. In the fourth round of wage talks Friday, unions refused to move from their demands and the government from its offer. The International Labour Organisation has been brought in to assist the parties to reach consensus. The current round of wage negotiations began over two months ago with various unions tabling a joint demand of a 7% wage increase. SABC News’ Mbongeni Muthwa reports on the resumption of the talks:  Cosatu’s Mugwena Maluleke has said while an agreement is not yet in sight, the organisation hopes government will have a change of heart and table a revised offer.
