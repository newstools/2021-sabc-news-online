Parliament’s Joint Defence Portfolio Committee has called Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula to appear before it to respond to allegations of corruption. Mapisa-Nqakula is alleged to have received gifts and cash to the value of R5 million from a South African National Defence Force (SANDF) supplier. The United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa brought the allegations to the attention of the committee, saying a whistle-blower presented them to him. Mapisa-Nqakula has written to the committee denying the allegations. However, Committee Co-chairperson Elleck Nchabeleng says they need more information from the Minister and the whistle-blower. “First engage and get time to engage the minister so we can get her responses and then we can ask questions. We need info from the whistle-blower, like a statement or an affidavit, at least we know someone has written something to us. We need something tangible from this person.” VIDEO: Holomisa implicates Minister Mapisa-Nqakula in a R5 million scandal: Chartered flights In April, the Democratic Alliance (DA) called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to institute an urgent investigation into allegations that Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula wasted millions of taxpayers’ money on chartered flights and luxury accommodation. The party says she must also be suspended without compensation pending the outcome of the investigation. DA Shadow Defence Minister Kobus Marais says a dossier of evidence has been submitted to the Joint Standing Committee on Defence, detailing at least five instances where doubt can be cast over Mapisa-Nqakula’s actions.
