President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to hand over land and title deeds to 30 black farmers at Tafelkop in Groblersdal in Limpopo province on Saturday. The Presidency says the deeds were registered earlier this year in the names of the beneficiaries. “President Ramaphosa will hand over land and title deeds to farmers who have been farming for 25 years on the land. The farmers supply their produces to local food stores, school feeding schemes as well the Pretoria and Johannesburg fresh produce markets.” “The extent of the land now officially registered in the names of the farmers is approximately 189 hectares and is valued at more than R25.5million,” says the Presidency.

More than 300 claimants received over R100 000 as compensation in 2006, after their successful land claim. The commission kept R10-million, which was to be used for community development. Claimants say when compensation funds for land that they lost were released, the commission informed them that R10-million of the funds would not be released to them, but would instead be used for community development. The claimants say 15 years later, the development still has not been done. Seventy-eight-year-old Mhlava Mabunda and 92-year-old Rangana Mabunda are some of the disgruntled beneficiaries: “We are not happy because we were not compensated as we were promised, they should have given us all of the money that was due to us.”
