The Road Traffic Inspectorate in KwaZulu-Natal says it is about to close the N3 Near Mooi River for the recovery of the tanker wreckage. Seven people were killed on Monday in a fire following a collision between a tanker carrying a hazardous substance, a bus and light motor vehicle.  KZN – N3 North (Update): #BusFire #TankerFire EMS say that there are now 7 x Fatalities at the scene https://t.co/tiN0Yk17th — Rob Beezy (@TrafficSA) May 10, 2021  Provincial inspectorate spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu says the recovery might take over an hour and traffic will be diverted. “In as much as we opened one lane there at Hidcote, we are currently about to do a recovery of a tanker and then we are going to close the freeway for an hour or so. We will divert traffic to R103 Traverton if need be. It will take an hour or so.” The KwaZulu-Natal Transport Department says preliminary reports about the fiery crash indicate that one of the vehicles lost control and hit oncoming traffic. The vehicles burst into flames on impact. Provincial Transport spokesperson Kwanele Ncalane says “Some bodies were burnt beyond recognition. We really find the situation quite disturbing. It is unacceptable especially because the preliminary reports suggest that one vehicle veered off and collided with oncoming vehicles and subsequently they caught fire.”
