The African National Congress (ANC) is to oppose the application brought by its suspended Secretary-General Ace Magashule to lift his temporary suspension. Magashule was suspended earlier in May after he refused to step aside pending the finalisation of the corruption case against him. He had since approached the courts to have his suspension lifted. ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe says they have sourced the legal services of the country’s top legal minds to oppose Magashule’s application. “The African National Congress national Officials met today, Monday, 17th of May 2021 and affirmed the decision to oppose the application lodged by the Secretary-General Comrade Ace Magashule to have, among others, his temporary suspension lifted. The ANC has appointed Ledwaba Mazwai Attorneys as instructing attorneys supported by the following three Senior Counsels and 1 Junior Counsel, respectively. Adv Wim Trengrove SC; Adv Ngwako Maenetje SC, Adv Fana Nalane SC and Adv Buhle Lekokotla” Magashule has vowed that he will never form a political party or leave the ANC. He says no one will ban him under a democracy nor remove the governing party from him. Magashule was speaking outside the High Court in Pietermaritzburg earlier on Monday. He was part of several high-ranking ANC officials who had gone there to support former President Jacob Zuma, who is facing fraud and corruption charges. Addressing Zuma’s supporters outside court Magashule said: “I am going to be short because I’m banned, but I can assure you…nobody – nobody under a democracy will ban me. Nobody will remove the ANC from me. I won’t form a party, I won’t leave the ANC and I[will] die in the ANC.”
