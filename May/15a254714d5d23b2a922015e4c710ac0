An urgent meeting has been called by the Premier of the Free State Sisi Ntombela to meet with leadership of the Mangaung Community Concerned Residents group. Bloemfontein was brought to a standstill on Monday due to protest action calling for the disbandment of the council and the removal of the City Manager amid claims of maladministration. Many streets in the city remain blocked with stones and rubble on Tuesday, while police can be seen in some parts to clear the roads to ease traffic flow as the shutdown protest continues. Very few people and motorists can be seen making their way around town and the location. The residents’ group has vowed to continue with the ongoing shutdown until their demands are taken seriously. Mangaung Metro spokesperson Qondile Khedama has appealed to residents to remain calm. Khedama says the meeting will look into finding solutions to issues raised by the community. “The intention is to really come with a solution to assist the city to get back to normal. We are making a clarion call to members of the community to be careful and to those that are still in the streets to calm down. We are working on the solution so the situation is back to normal in Mangaung,” says Khedama.
