The Health Department has confirmed 11 cases of the B1.1.7 variant that was first detected in the United Kingdom, and four cases of the B1.617.2 variant that was first detected in India. These variants have now spread to countries across the world, including South Africa. So far, South Africa has registered over 1.5 million COVID-19 cases with over 54 000 deaths. Professor Karim says that the inter-connectedness of the world means the inability to control the movement of new variants, from one country to another. The B1.1.7 variant that was first discovered in the United Kingdom in the first week of December 2020, has now spread to over a hundred countries. Karima is appealing to South Africans to rather focus their energies on remaining vigilance and managing their own behaviour, to remain protected. He says the current isolated cases of other variants on South African shores is not an immediate concern. “At this stage, probably not! If you follow the rules, you have a good chance of not getting infected. If you were infected in the second wave you are likely to have some level of protection against this variant because of the common mutation. The third is that, for those who’ve been vaccinated, like healthcare workers, they will have a level of protection against this virus.” On the issue of perhaps banning visitors from particular countries, Karim says that comes from the tendency to put blame on other people. “It’s because the temptation is to blame others; not to blame ourselves, when we’re walking around seeing all these people not obeying the rules. It’s convenient. Let’s blame someone else, they are bringing the COVID here, not that we are responsible for spreading our own COVID here,” says Karim.
