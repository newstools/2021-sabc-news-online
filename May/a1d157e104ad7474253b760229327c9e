Alleged Cape Town underworld figure Nafiz Modack and four suspects are expected back in the Bishop Lavis Magistrate’s Court on Monday on several charges including murder, racketeering and extortion. Former rugby player Zane Killian and Modack face charges relating to the killing of top cop Charl Kinnear who was gunned down last year. Jacques Cronje, Ricardo Morgan and anti-gang unit member Ashley Tabisher also face a number of charges. The state alleges that Modack offered Tabisher money in exchange for information on when police would carry out raids against him. Morgan, a car salesman, who faces charges of racketeering and money laundering, was granted bail of R50 000. According to the Hawks, he is also linked to Kinnear’s murder.
