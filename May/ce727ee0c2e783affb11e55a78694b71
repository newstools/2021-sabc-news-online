The Democratic Alliance in the Western Cape is expected to elect an interim provincial leader before the end of the month. This follows the resignation of former leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela. DA provincial chairperson, Jaco Londt, says the party’s Provincial Executive Committee has started the process of nominations to elect an interim leader. Madikizela resigned from all his positions last month after he became embroiled in a controversy related to falsifying qualifications. Londt says the election will take place at the end of May. “According to the Federal and Provincial Constitutions, a provincial leader can only be elected at a Provincial Congress. Therefore, the leader elected on 29 May 2021 at the Provincial Council meeting, will act as interim leader until the next Provincial Congress.”
