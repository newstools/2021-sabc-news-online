India’s entire delegation to the Group of Seven (G7) summit in London is self-isolating after two of its members tested positive for COVID-19, the British government said on Wednesday. “Two delegates tested positive so the entire delegation is now self-isolating,” a British official said. “The meeting had been enabled by a strict set of COVID-19 protocols, including daily testing of all delegates,” the British official said. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyan Jaishankar said on Wednesday he will join ongoing G7 meetings in London virtually after he was informed about exposure to people with possible coronavirus infection. Sky News reported earlier that two members of India’s delegation had tested positive for COVID-19. “Was made aware yesterday evening of exposure to possible COVID positive cases,” Jaishankar said in a tweet. “As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well.” India is not a G7 member but was invited by Britain to this week’s summit, along with Australia, South Africa and South Korea.
