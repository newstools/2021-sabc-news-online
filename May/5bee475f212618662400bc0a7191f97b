The water levels of dams supplying Cape Town have spiked to 74% following steady rains over the past week. Western Cape Local Government Minister, Anton Bredell, says dams were at 52% this time last year. He says the province’s largest dam Theewaterskloof, near Grabouw, currently has a capacity of 80% which is a 6% rise since last week. The Voëlvlei Dam near Saron is at 60%, the Bergriver Dam at 83% while the Garden Route Dam near George is 100% full. Bredell says the Clanwilliam Dam on the West Coast currently stands at 16%.
