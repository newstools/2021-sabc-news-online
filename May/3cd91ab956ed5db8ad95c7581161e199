Mangaung concerned residents have vowed to continue with the ongoing shutdown in Bloemfontein on Tuesday despite the fatal shooting of a teenager on Monday. The group’s spokesperson, Motlatsi Mokgatla, says their past attempts to engage the Mangaung Metro about poor service delivery and the exclusion of Bloemfontein residents from jobs failed to yield positive results, hence the decision to protest. Residents of BFN have taken their frustrations to the streets over poor service delivery and irregular appointments at the Mangaung Metro municipality. They are also calling for the disbandment of the municipal council. #sabcnews#sabcfs pic.twitter.com/tczquqaJ36 — Aphumelele Mdlalane (@AphumeleleMdla2) May 17, 2021  Mokgatla says they want the Mangaung Metro council to be disbanded and the city manager to step down. “In our meeting, we had agreed that we are going to continue with the shutdown until at least the municipality can come to us and say look this is where we agree in terms of demands, so that there can be something we take back to the community; because the mandate that we got is that we are going to continue to engage Mangaung through a shutdown because the roundtable has proven to be a failure because they are dishonest in their dealing. That has become their trademark.” Teenager fatally shot A teenage boy died during violent protests after he was shot allegedly by a security guard. Police say the guard fired shots in an attempt to scare the mob at a warehouse, resulting in the death of the 15-year-old boy, as outlined in the video below:
