Renowned epidemiologist, Professor Salim Abdool Karim, has called on the medical sector to prepare hospitals and healthcare workers for a potential third wave of the coronavirus. This as South Africa records an increase in new daily cases with the Health Department having reported 4 623 new infections in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to over 1 million-645 000. Another 102 people have died from COVID-19-related illnesses, taking the death toll to over 56 000. Prof Karim has advised against complacency on health protocols. “The first is that people have become complacent and we need to raise the alert level for people to understand the situation is no longer Level one but we are now in a situation that is different. And I think that is important to send that signal. Second, is that we have to do something about reducing the size of gatherings because that can speed up the transmission by creating super spreading events and the third, is we need to go and prepare our hospitals for the coming surge.” Reaction to increasing COVID-19 infections: Prof. Abdool Karim  SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 339 241 197 333 65 008 81 586 11 656 2 ﻿415 1 ﻿438 DEATHS 4 ﻿263 11 099 10 497 1 ﻿889 1 ﻿046 86163 448 366 74 243 48 616 292 228  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 98 934 26 MAY 2021 1 645 555 56 077 11 452 185 1 546 583 4 623 102 Vaccination Phase 2 282 135 11 774 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
