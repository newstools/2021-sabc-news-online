The World Health Organisation (WHO) has approved the Sinopharm vaccine for COVID-19 emergencies. While China has already distributed the vaccine to many countries, others were reluctant to use it prior to approval by the World health body. The organisation has also called on the G7 to support developing nations trying to rebuild their economies. WHO says they have reviewed data on quality of the vaccine:  The organisation has emphasized the importance of ensuring societies across Africa be provided with coronavirus vaccines in efforts to slow the spread of the virus. WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was speaking during a virtual joint meeting of AU Ministers of Health on COVID-19 in Africa. He has reiterated the WHO’s call for people across Africa to continue wearing masks, practice social distancing and sanitizing their hands “I commend the Africa CDC and the AU for the launch of the partnership for African vaccine manufacturing and we seek the support of AU countries for the draft resolution on local production at the forthcoming World Health Assembly.” “Vaccines are giving us all the hope of light at the end of the tunnel. The same public health measures that have been the bedrock of the continental strategy must remain central to the response.” Ghebreyesus adds: The same public health measures that have been the bedrock of the continental strategy must remain central to the response. That means strengthened surveillance, increased testing careful contact tracing, supported quarantine and compassionate care. It means empowering and engaging communities to continue with the individual precautions that we know work – physical distancing, avoiding crowds, wearing masks, cleaning hands and opening windows.”
