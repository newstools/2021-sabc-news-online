Malawi has postponed rolling out the second shot of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine from May to June. This follows news that not many were vaccinated during the first phase due to poor information flow to ordinary people. Currently, close to 311 000 out of the targeted 2.6 million people have benefited from the vaccine, which authorities insist is not mandatory. Malawi’s Minister of Health, Khumbize Chiponda says,  “In the last 24 hours, we have conducted 429 tests. Of these, we have eight new cases. We have had one death, unfortunately. We have had new recoveries and the number is four. In our hospitals, we have 11 COVID-19 patients. Amongst us, we still have 730 active cases and that is why we are urging all Malawians that we need to take caution. That we need to continue wearing masks.”
