This follows talks between Kenyaâ€™s President Uhuru Kenyatta and Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan, who is in Kenya on a two-day state visit. The two leaders agreed that a joint team of experts will come up with modalities for mutual recognition of COVID-19 tests to allow the smooth flow of people and goods across the borders.
