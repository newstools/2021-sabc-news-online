Deputy Correctional Services Minister, Phatekile Holomisa, says officials having sex with inmates is a huge embarrassment to the department. Officials briefed Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on various issues including alleged incidents of sexual acts involving inmates and officials. Recently, a cellphone video emerged of a KwaZulu-Natal official having sexual relations with an inmate. Holomisa says while this is regrettable, they have ethical and awareness programmes in place for members of staff. “Whilst this has been embarrassing, to say the least, it’s an opportunity for the department to further interrogate its systems, security detail, code of conduct and ethical behaviour within the department.” Dismissed offials Last month, two officials from the Ncome Correctional Facility in KwaZulu-Natal were dismissed following an investigation into a sex video involving a correctional services official and an inmate. South Africans were shocked when the footage went viral on social media last month. The official in the video and her colleague who allowed her office to be used for the sex romp were both dismissed.
