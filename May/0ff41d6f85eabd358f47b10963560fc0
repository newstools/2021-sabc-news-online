Former Passenger Rail Agency of South African CEO Lucky Montana, has remained steadfast in denying allegations that Siyangena Technologies bought him properties valued at R36 million as a kickback for brokering tender deals for it. Montana has returned to the Commission of Inquiry into Allegations State Capture in Johannesburg to testify. He says the commission has not presented him with evidence to show the connection between the R36 million and his properties. On Monday, Montana told the commission that he bought four of his properties after getting a loan from Absa bank. He has again requested the commission to look at his bank statements. “That the story that this agreement is false – I hope that the commission will present me with the supporting evidence,” says Montana. “I explained it’s a Paul O’ Sullivan story. The commission has now elevated false evidence,” he says.
