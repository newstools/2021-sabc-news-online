Professor of Vaccinology at Wits University Shabir Madhi says the COVID-19 third-wave could be less severe provided the virus does not mutate into yet another new, more dangerous variant. He was addressing the media in Johannesburg as part of the Gauteng COVID Command council on Friday. He predicts that the COVID-19 third wave will hit Gauteng in three weeks time. He says some people in Gauteng have some resistance after being infected in the past. Madhi says people should nevertheless be vaccinated. He says there’s a need to speedily roll out the vaccination programme, especially in high-risk groups. “The target is to get 40-million people vaccinated. In fact, we don’t need to get 40-million people to get to a relatively normal lifestyle. What we need to do is get 80 to 90% of the high-risk groups vaccinated. And if we can do that we can get back to a normal lifestyle. COVID-19 is going to be here for the rest of our lifetime, we need to be comfortable with that. But it is about protecting people from dying. And it is about preventing our hospitals from being overwhelmed and the way to do that is to vaccinate high-risk individuals.
