Commission of Inquiry into State Capture chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has directed the secretary of the commission to lay a criminal case against former South African Airways board chairperson Dudu Myeni. This after Myeni failed to appear before the commission on Tuesday morning despite getting a summons. Zondo has instructed Myeni’s legal team to make sure that she appears before the commission in at 2PM to give Eskom-related evidence. “There appears to not have been any valid reasons for her to not to appear. Three the secretary of the commission must take steps to lay a criminal complaint with the South African Police service, acting in bridge of the summons and the Commission’s act.  I direct she should make herself available to give evidence today whether its via zoom or any of the methods used by her to appear virtually.” Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo instructs Dudu Myeni to appear before the Commission at 2PM:  Earlier, Myeni’s lawyer, Advocate Nqabayethu Buthelezi, told the commission that his client’s failure to appear before it on Thursday morning was not tantamount to defiance but rather what he termed miscommunication. He said she had received the summons requesting her presence at the commission, but a response from the commission on certain questions she wanted answered came late. Zondo has ordered Myeni through her legal team, to find a place and computer where she can log in virtually to give evidence. “Whatever is a workable solution, but one thing that is absent in all of this is her reluctance to appear chair, so it may inconvenience the commission and we apologise chair and as far as it seeks to imply there is defiance of the summons, I submit chair there is none. There is no such intention and we have indicated in the last paragraph that says we request a stay of execution.” Dudu Myeni’s legal representative advocate Buthelezi asks for postponement:  In the video below, Zondo confirms Myeni will testify virtually:
