Former eThekwini Deputy Mayor Logie Naidoo says the late attorney Theasen Pillay’s legal and humanitarian work will be remembered for a long time by those he interacted with. The prominent Durban attorney was found dead at his Umhlanga apartment on Friday. He was 47 years old. Police have since started investigating his death after confirming that his body was found with stab wounds to one of the arms and the chest. Pillay’s funeral service will be held this Wednesday. Naidoo, who considers himself a close friend to Pillay, has described him as a generous person. “As a professional, he mixed with everyone. He was involved in so many charities, community upliftment programmes. He was very generous. The donations and programmes that he embarked on. What I saw in Theasen is that he is walking in his father’s footsteps in doing wonderful work. As a legal professional, you can get so engrossed in your work, but Theasen took his time and got involved in so many projects,” says Naidoo. #Headline As police investigate the alleged murder of Durban attorney, Theasen Pillay, close friend Logie Naidoo remembers both his legal and humanitarian work @lotusfm #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/6TP7V8Yf78 — Newsbreak (@Newsbreak_Lotus) May 10, 2021
