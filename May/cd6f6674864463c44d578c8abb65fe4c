Police in the North West have had their hands full since Monday morning, dispersing residents who had blockaded some roads leading into Mafikeng. The R503 road linking Mahikeng and Lichtenburg and N18 linking Mahikeng and Vryburg were earlier barricaded with various objects. The residents are protesting against lack of service delivery, unemployment, poverty, the neglect of tourism attractions in Mahikeng, and the selling of properties built during the Bophuthatswana governance which include residential and commercial properties. They say the selling of Bop properties is stripping the province of the Bophuthatswana government legacy, instead of uplifting the economy of the province Police Spokesperson Sabata Mokgwaabone says they have now opened the R503, while Vryburg road is still closed at Makhubung village. ‘The police have since managed to disperse protestors at Dihatshwane village and opened the road where traffic is now flowing. In the Mahikeng / Vryburg road near Kedirile inn, the road has also been opened. However, in Makhubung village, the road is still closed. As a result, we are urging motorists to exercise caution and to cooperate with the law enforcement officials who are controlling traffic.” Local roads in Mahikeng blockaded:
