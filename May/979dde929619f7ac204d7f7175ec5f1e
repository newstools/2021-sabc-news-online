Gauteng police have condemned a mob justice incident that left four people dead in Zandspruit near Honeydew, north of Johannesburg. Police Spokesperson Kay Makhubele says no arrests have been made. He says police are investigating cases of murder and attempted murder. It’s understood a group of nine young men was taken to a local sports ground in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The young men were then beaten up by angry residents who accused them of terrorising the community. Makhubele says five others, who survived, are in a critical condition in hospital. “We can confirm that there was mob justice and Gauteng police Commissioner Mawela has condemned the mob justice following the killing of four people,” says Makhubele. Makhubele says five people were seriously injured in the attack and taken to hospital. “Early this morning, a group of about 200 people went to search for the boys who allegedly robbed the community members in Zandspruit area. Nine of them were found and were beaten up and set alight. Four of them died on the scene. The intelligence people are on the ground to gather information so that those who were involved will be brought to book,” Makhubele said.
