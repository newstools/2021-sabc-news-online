Five Northern Cape schools have been closed due to coronavirus (COVID-19) cases, two in Kimberley and three at Delportshoop near Barkley West. The department has dismissed claims that proper COVID-19 decontamination processes were not followed at the schools. There are concerns about the rising number of COVID-19 cases in South Africa. The provincial Spokesperson for the Department, Lehuma Ntuane, says the affected schools will be reopened soon. “We currently have a total number of five schools that have closed due to COVID-19 cases and it’s very important to mention that we are working closely with the Department of Health in this regard. Our decision to close schools is based on their advice. We will never neglect or put the lives of learners and educators at risk. Our schools are still using the rotation system as part of controlling and managing COVID-19 within the confines of the school.” Third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic The province currently has 6 159 active COVID-19 cases. The number of deaths in the province currently stands at 987 with 37 797 recoveries. The number of cases has been increasing across different provinces in South Africa. The total cumulative cases is 1 526 638 and in total 55 260 people have died in South Africa. There have been growing concerns about the third wave of the virus. Speaking at the official opening of a refurbished mining hospital in Carletonville, west of Johannesburg, Gauteng Premier David Makhura confirmed that the province has reached the third wave. The Health Department says it is working with provinces to update their resurgence plans to ensure they are ready to deal with a possible influx of COVID-19 cases. The Department of Health has assured South Africans that the country is not experiencing the third wave, however, the risk remains.
