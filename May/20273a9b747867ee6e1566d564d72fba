President Cyril Ramaphosa says he will only make a decision on the fate of Health Minister Doctor Zweli Mkhize’s fate after receiving a report from the Special Investigations Unit (SIU). Pressure is mounting on Ramaphosa to act against Mkhize following his latest admission that the awarding of the R150 million tender to communications company Digital Vibes – a company co-owned by the Health Minister, was irregular. Mkhize made the admission on Wednesday, following the outcome of an internal investigation into the tender awarded to his former private assistant, Tahera Mathera, and former spokesperson, Naardhira Mitha who are reported to control the company – although the two are not listed as directors.
