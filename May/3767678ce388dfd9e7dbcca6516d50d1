Eskom has announced that Stage 1 load shedding will start at 5pm Wednesday afternoon and last until 10 pm tonight. The cash-strapped power utility says this is because of a shortage of generation due to station breakdowns and delays in returning some units to service. Eskom says load shedding could continue this week if the power stations are not brought back online.  #POWERALERT2 Stage 1 loadshedding will be implemented from 17:00 until 22:00 tonight due to shortage of generation capacity pic.twitter.com/MUtfpR98xl â€” Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) May 26, 2021
