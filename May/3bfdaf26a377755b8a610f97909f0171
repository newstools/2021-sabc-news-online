Two men accused of the murder of 21-year-old Paul Roux farm manager Brandin Horner are expected to appear in the Senekal magistrate court later on Friday morning. 32-year-old Sekwetje Mahlamba and a 44-year-old Sekola Matlaletsa allegedly strangled and stabbed Horner and left his body tied to the bottom of a pole in October 2020. The court is expecting to hear the results of DNA tests after blood stains were found on the clothes of the accused. The court wants to determine if the blood matches that of Horner. The incident at the time raised racial tensions in the Senekal area. The first appearance of the accused saw scores of farmers from across the country converge in the farming town to show their support to the victimâ€™s family. They called for the death penalty and stormed into the court building demanding that the accused be handed over to them. The situation turned ugly when a police van was overturned and set alight by angry farmers. Every court appearance has seen heavy police deployment.
