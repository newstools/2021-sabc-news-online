Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and Environmental Affairs Barbara Creecy has launched the second phase of a wildlife economy initiative in the North West. The launch took place at Koedoeberg in Groot Marico, where more than 100 game animals were donated to an emerging game farmer, Andrew Aphane. Creecy says the donation and loan of 354 animals to eight successful emerging game farmers and communities coincides with the commemoration of World Biodiversity Day. “In the North West window, two of the game donation is supporting eight farmers. This is what we call a loan of game, so all together we are loaning 352 animals and the idea is that these animals that will be released on these farms will live here for a number of years then reproduce,” says Creecy.
