The National Education, Health and Allied Worker’s Union (Nehawu) in parliament has rejected calls by the National Treasury for the institution to align its salary increases for its staff component with that of the public sector. Workers in parliament got a 6% salary increase for this year. Last week, Treasury briefed parliament and alluded that staff wages should be in line with those of the public sector.
