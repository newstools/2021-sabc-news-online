The leaders will discuss how to meet the new European Union (EU) target, agreed in April, to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, against 1990 levels. The EU’s executive Commission is due to publish a set of climate policy proposals in July, including carbon market reforms and tougher carbon dioxide standards for vehicles. All will need approval from its 27 member states. The previous target was 40%. The talks will shed light on what policy changes EU governments are likely to accept. -Additional reporting by Reuters
