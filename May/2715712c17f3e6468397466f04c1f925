United States (US) President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden returned to the White House late Sunday evening (May 23) after spending the weekend at Camp David. Camp David is the storied retreat in the mountains of western Maryland that many of Biden’s predecessors found to be a rustic getaway from the political battles of Washington. Nestled in the Catoctin Mountains, the heavily guarded compound operated by the US Navy provided a refuge for Jimmy Carter to fish and George W. Bush to ride his mountain bike. It has also been the site of high-pressure negotiations. Bill Clinton, hoping to recreate the magic of Carter’s Camp David Accords of 1978, brought together Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at Camp David in 2000 for a summit but failed to reach a breakthrough in the long-standing conflict. On Monday (May 24), Biden is expected to visit the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters in D.C. to receive a briefing on the Atlantic hurricane outlook and preparedness efforts and on Tuesday (May 25), he will mark the first anniversary of the death of George Floyd.
