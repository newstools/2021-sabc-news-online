The African National Congress (ANC) has convened a three-day extended Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) meeting at the East London International Convention Centre in the Eastern Cape. Former ANC President, Thabo Mbeki, is expected to make presentations on the unity and renewal of the party. He will contribute to how to reassert the ANC as a movement rooted among the people. ANC PEC spokesperson, Loyiso Magqashela, says the meeting will also draw on the legacy of the founders of the party for the benefit of the current generation. “To strengthen the issue of the organisational renewal and unity, we have then to tap from the wisdom of those who led before so that at least our renewal trajectory gets to be guided and guided properly. You would have nowadays understood how the ANC is pressured from left, right and centre. Now the renewal project then becomes key.  We want to assert the authority and the leadership of the ANC amongst the society,” says Magqashela. Magqashela says on Monday the organisation will engage various community stakeholders to listen to their concerns. “We shall be bringing all those stakeholders under one roof because what is important is for us to then say here are the people, what is it that concerns them in the presence of the leadership so that at least when they present, the former President gets an opportunity to speak to those people and try and respond to whatever issues they would raise.” As ANC EC kickstarts its 3 day Extended PEC meeting at EL ICC, Dr W.B Rubusana Region this morning, it’s expected to be joined by the former ANC President Cde Thabo Mbeki.@MYANC@ANCParliament @TMFoundation_@OscarMabuyane @LulamaNgcuka @Jamilogy @mdantsanekas @mfundozs pic.twitter.com/RpgGpcaMjl — ANC Eastern Cape (@ANCECape) May 29, 2021
