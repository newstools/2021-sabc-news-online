Metrobus drivers are set to go on strike on Monday morning in a move that is likely to leave about 30 000 commuters stranded. Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers’ Union of South Africa (Demawusa) members will stage a picket at Gandhi Square in Johannesburg from 10:00 on Monday. Update on ongoing industrial action at Metrobus. pic.twitter.com/84FJNrTnxX — Joburg Metrobus (@JoburgMetrobus) May 7, 2021  The action comes after both the union and the employer deadlocked during salary negotiations last week. The union has demanded an 18% salary increase. However, Metrobus previously said it unable to meet that demand. The union has also raised concerns relating to salary disparities and unfair dismissals. Metrobus once again regrets to inform commuters that industrial action by DEMAWUSA continues, as a result disrupting all planned trips. We will further update our valuable commuters tomorrow noon of new developments. pic.twitter.com/TE7QLUf2mn — Joburg Metrobus (@JoburgMetrobus) May 5, 2021  The union has also raised concerns relating to salary disparities and unfair dismissals. They say they will not back down until their demands are met. The service covers over 300 scheduled routes including 128 school routes in Johannesburg. It’s estimated that at least 30 000 commuters use the service daily. Bus commuters left stranded – Maageketla Mohlabe updates
