South Africa’s COVID-19 vaccine first phase roll-out plan has reached just over three-hundred and ninety-five thousand health workers as at 10 May 2021. Phase one kicked off in mid-February and is expected to end next week on the 17th of May 2021. With the second phase rolling out in May, phase two is expected to reach vulnerable members of our society and is set to continue until October. The roll-out has been slower than the global roll-out after a batch of AstraZeneca doses was returned when there were uncertainties regarding the expiry date of the consignment.  According to Ourworldindata.org, the global percentage of people vaccinated for COVID-19 stands at 4,1% whilst only 0,7% of South Africans have been vaccinated. A third of the health practitioner workforce has been inoculated to date. See infographic below for more:
