Firefighters from the City of Johannesburg are still conducting damping down operations following Saturday night’s fire at a warehouse in Fordsburg. The blaze damaged several floors of the six-story warehouse. Five fire engines as well as several other EMS vehicles have blockaded Central Road to ensure the safety of motorists and pedestrians, should the fire re-ignite. It’s unclear how long it will take fire fighters to conclude their damping down operations. The cause of the fire is still unknown at this stage. Emergency services say they will be conducting an investigation later today. No injuries or fatalities have been reported:
