The Free State Education Department is concerned that schools appear to be super spreaders of the coronavirus in the latest spike in infections. Education spokesperson Howard Ndaba says 32 learners from Reutlwahetse High School in Excelsior have tested positive for the virus this week and are receiving necessary support. Ndaba says that infections in schools in Ladybrand are also a major concern. “We are equally concerned about the rising cases of COVID-19 especially in the most affected area which is Mantsopa Municipality, in Ladybrand and in Excelsior. In Excelsior as I’m speaking to you now, there’s a school that has about 32 learners who tested positive and we really attribute that to things that are outside the school because in most cases this usually happens after long weekends.” SA COVID-19 stats South Africa has recorded 2 073 new coronavirus infections in the last 24-hour cycle, taking the total number to 1 588 221.
