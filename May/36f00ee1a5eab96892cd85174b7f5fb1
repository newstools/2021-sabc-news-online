The Modjadji royal family has distanced itself from a decision by the royal council to deviate from the matrilineal monarchs of the Balobedu dynasty in Limpopo. The family says they were not part of the decision that Prince Lekukela Modjadji will ascend the throne instead of his sister, Princess Masalanabo Modjadji. The coronation of the Prince has been scheduled for October 2022. Advocate Ngoako Moropene on Prince Lekukela being appointed as the leader for the Balobedu nation:  Representative of the royal family, Tebogo Modjadji-Kekana, says Princess Masalanabo, her guardians and representatives of the family were not party to discussions that led to the decision to install prince Lekukela as the next monarch. She blames the royal council for sowing divisions within the Balobedu nation. “We are not going to let it slide; as we speak, we are taking action. To us, Masalanabo is still a Queen. Masalanabo was acknowledged by the president, Masalanabo was acknowledged in public; Lekukela was not even acknowledged by the public and the president. The current Royal Council, they are null and void and we are going to dissolve them.” The Modjadji royal family refute claims of deviating from their tradition of Balobedu queenship:  Petitions opposing the Prince Several petitions have been started on social media to oppose Prince Lekukela’s installation. The originator of one of the petitions, Samuel Manyama, says they will take the petition to Traditional Affairs Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, once it gets 2 000 signatures. “This petition caught fire. To date, we have had over 5 million views on the petition and 1 200 signatures and comments, which we are planning to table to Minister Nkosazana Dlamini- Zuma.”
