President Cyril Ramaphosa says although the ANC National Disciplinary Committee (NDC) has cleared Khusela Diko from wrongdoing, she remains suspended from her position as Presidential spokesperson. Diko has been cleared along with former Gauteng Health MEC Bandile Masuku following the Personal Protective Equipment corruption saga. Speaking after handing over title deeds to black farmers at Tafelkop in Groblersdal in Limpopo, Ramaphosa said Tyrone Seale would continue to act as Presidential spokesperson as the Presidency initiated an internal disciplinary process against Diko. “The Disciplinary Committee has ruled in her favour so that matter is obviously being handled at the Gauteng provincial level and that too will run its full course, so let’s allow that to happen. Well, all those processes have to be allowed to happen. So, she’s still on suspension. So, let’s allow all that to be properly handled.” Meanwhile, Masuku has welcomed the ANC’s NDC ruling clearing him and Khusela Diko of any wrongdoing. The committee says Masuku and Diko can return to their political functions as Gauteng Executive Committee members. ANC national spokesperson, Pule Mabe, says they will discuss the committee’s ruling with the party’s National Working Committee. “We don’t get instructed by statements written by Bandile Masuku on how we must conduct our work. We’ll raise this point with the National Working Committee. They will be able to guide us on how we should move because the ANC is an organisation of process. It is not for members to issue statements on the decision taken. Those internal organisational structures have got the power to communicate their own decisions and immediately individual members take away that right or power then it creates a crisis.” ANC Disciplinary Committee rules in favour of Dr Bandile Masuku, Khusela Diko in PPE scandal:
