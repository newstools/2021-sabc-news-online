The African National Congress (ANC) will hold its much anticipated virtual National Executive Committee meeting later on Saturday morning. The meeting is called to consider reports from the provinces on the step aside resolution. So far, party Secretary-General Ace Magashule is also expected to step aside in keeping with the resolution. Other senior party members include MP Bongani Bongo and KZN Deputy Provincial Chairperson Mike Mabuyakhulu. Magashule has vowed to participate in the NEC, despite his letter of suspension stating that he may not carry out duties and responsibilities of his office as the Secretary-General. Magashule was suspended earlier this week as part of the implementation of the ANC’s step-aside resolution. But he says he is going nowhere. Speaking during an exclusive interview with SABC News, Magashule alleged that no legal processes have been followed by the NEC in his suspension and that the top leadership of the governing party should rather have exhausted internal processes in dealing with differences. Magashule was asked whether he was worried about being expelled over his letter to ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa, allegedly sent without consulting the ANC’s top leadership, informing the president that Ramaphosa had also been suspended … “The ANC character is being changed. And I won’t go down comrades as part of those who want to change the character of the ANC, the people’s movement. Is not the organisation of leaders. People say let’s vote. People use their power to say we summarise. No, it has never happened in the ANC. This is in an NEC of special meetings, let’s call a meeting next week. We give you 7 days comrade to resign. The people who give me 7 days are the people who received money in their accounts.” EXCLUSIVE | In conversation with suspended ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule:  Additional reporting by Ditaba Tsotetsi
