The union said firefighters are being required to work long hours without any form of compensation. City of Cape Town’s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, Alderman JP Smith, rejected the allegations. Smith also denied Samwu’s claims that the city is planning to dismiss over 500 firefighters. Samwu said the firefighters have been engaged in a wage dispute with the city over the long hours they are required to work on weekends and public holidays since 2010. The union said the firefighters intend to join the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in its upcoming public servants’ wage strike.
