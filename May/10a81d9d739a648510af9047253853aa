Two suspects are expected to appear in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on charges of fraud and the contravention of the Immigration Act. The suspects were arrested by the Hawks. It is believed that in 2018, the suspects were illegally trafficked from India to South Africa as cheap labour. Hawks Spokesperson, Katlego Mogale, says the men submitted fraudulent documents to the Home Affairs Department to apply for permanent residence. “The suspects were arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation team, with the Department of Home Affairs’ Immigration Inspectorate, during a sting operation at Eshowe and Nongoma.  It is alleged that in 2018, the suspects were illegally trafficked from India for cheap labour practices. They were allegedly promised better job opportunities and permanent residence permits. Fraudulent documents, which includes police clearances, contracts of employment and medical records were submitted to the Home Affairs department for permanent residence permit applications.  The team proceeded to the North Coast of the province, searching for the suspects until they were apprehended. Their permits were immediately revoked and the investigation is continuing.”
