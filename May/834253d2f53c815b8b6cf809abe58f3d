The first group of Eastern Cape senior citizens are getting their COVID-19 vaccines at the Provincial hospital in Gqeberha on Monday. The hospital can administer 400 vaccines per day. The province is aiming to vaccinate 770 000 senior citizens by the end of July. Those who got vaccinated in Gqeberha say the process was quick and painless. “I was sitting in a chair…and the nurse said I was done already. And I felt absolutely nothing. So I’m quite happy with the process,” says one elderly resident. Another says: “The process was very efficient here at provincial. Initially, we went to Livingston but the line was quite long so they sent us here. I am 70 and my wife is 65. They moved us to the front of the queue and it went quickly from there.” In the video below, elderly citizens talk about the vaccination drive in the Eastern Cape:
