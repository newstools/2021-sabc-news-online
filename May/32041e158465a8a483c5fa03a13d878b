The Department of Education in the Free State maintains there was no irregular expenditure between them and Kagiso Shanduka Trust. The department has denied media reports that suggest the department has awarded Kagiso Shanduka Trust a tender to build schools. Free State education department spokesperson Howard Ndaba says they are prepared to take the matter to court. Ndaba says the relationship it has with the Trust has always been a non profit partnership. “Nobody, Kagiso Shanduka or Kagiso Trust did not get a tender to build the school. We formed a partnership and made sure that we deliver quality education in those schools and we are happy with that.” “We still believe as the Free State Department of education, there was no irregular expenditure in this project. And we want to put on record that we are prepared to even go to court for a declaratory order for the court to determine whether this partnership was irregular or not,” explains Ndaba. In April, President Cyril Ramaphosa denied that his previous company was involved in a tender to build a school in the Free State in 2015.
