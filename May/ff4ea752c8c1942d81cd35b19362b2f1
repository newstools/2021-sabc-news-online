The City of Tshwane is urging residents to grant meter reading officials,  with identity cards, access to their properties for the purposes of meter readings and inspections. The municipality says actual meter readings are required to ensure the accuracy of service bills. Municipal Spokesperson, Selby Bokaba, says residents may submit their own meter readings. However, it is important to keep to the submission dates scheduled for specific areas. According to Section 101 of the Local Government: Municipal Systems, 2000 (Act 32 of 2000),  the occupier of a property in a municipality must give an authorised representative of the municipality or of a service provider access at all reasonable hours to the premises in order to read, inspect, install or repair any meter or service. This is also in line with the electricity and water by-laws.
