South Africa is set to deliver more than 5 000 tons of maize to Zimbabwe this week. International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor will hand over the consignment on Tuesday to victims of the 2019 Cyclone Idai. The International Relations Department says the outbreak of the COVID-19 delayed the implementation of the project, which will now be completed by September 2021. South Africa, through the African Renaissance and International Cooperation Fund (ARF), pledged R50 million in humanitarian support. The assistance consists 450 000 bags of 12,5 kg maize meal, to be distributed to the affected families. Cyclone Idai ravaged through Southern Africa killing over 1 000 people in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Malawi. Millions were displaced.
