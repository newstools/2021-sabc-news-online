The following story contains graphic description, which may upset sensitive listeners, including children. The family of a 48-year-old man who was found dead in Tshakhuma outside Thohoyandou, in Limpopo say they suspect that he was killed for ritual purposes because some of his body parts are missing. Pandelani Ndishavhelafhi was reported missing in April and his decomposing remains were found in the veld in Tshakhuma last week. Residents allegedly burnt down a house and a vehicle on Saturday night, belonging to a man accused of being responsible for his killing. Ndishavhelafhi’s sister, Ndivhaleni Muvhango, says the remains did not have hands and feet when they were discovered. “It was hard to us because we had searched him for a long time without success. What makes us feel sad is that the state of the body when it was discovered, we found remains without hands and feet and that causes more pain to us. Our suspicion is that he was ritual-murdered. Now, we are going to bury an incomplete body.”
