Continuous rain in the Cape Metro since Wednesday night, and heavy downpours on Thursday morning, has caused discomfort to some residents while disrupting and frustrating others trying to get to work in the city on Thursday. The Disaster Risk Management Centre (DRMC) remains on high alert as more hard rain is expected for the rest of Thursday and possibly Friday. DRMC’s Spokesperson, Charlotte Powell, says flooding has been reported in some areas. “Flooding has been reported in the Gugulethu, Massacar Village and Phillipi East areas. The DRMC will conduct assessments and activate the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) to provide soft relief if required. Weather-related power outages have been reported in Joe Slovo in Milnerton and Noordhoek. Various roads across the city were flooded due to blocked drains. These are being attended to by the Roads and Stormwater Department. Increase in dam levels Dam levels in the City of Cape Town increased by 1.2% over the last week and currently stand at 69.8%.
