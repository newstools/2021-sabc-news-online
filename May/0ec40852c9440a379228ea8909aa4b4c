The Sol Plaatje Municipality in Kimberley in the Northern Cape will continue with water cuts, but only on Wednesday evening. The municipality has suspended daytime water interruptions after the city experienced water cuts for almost two days. Sol Plaatje Municipality spokesperson, Thoko Riet, says the burst pipe, which led to water leakages, has been fully restored. “There is no planned interruption in the interim. We will however still continue with the nightly shutdown until our levels have reached full capacity. Nightly shutdown starts at eight in the evening until 5 am the next morning.” Sol Plaatje Municipality residents frustrated by lack of service delivery:  Jan Kempdorp protests The Department of Cooperative Governance in the Northern Cape has vowed to respond to residents of Jan Kempdorp within the next seven days. Residents took to the streets demanding proper housing, clean water supply, storm water drains, streetlights and recreational facilities. A task team of MECs lead by the MEC of Cooperative Governance, Bentley Vaas, visited the area. The Provincial Head for the Department of Cooperative Governance, Bafedile Lenkoe, says community members agreed to give the department seven days. “We have agreed with the community members and the community at large that within seven days we will give feedback to them based on what their demands are in line with the response that we will be giving to them.”
