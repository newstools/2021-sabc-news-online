The National Union of Mineworkers (Num) in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) has expressed concerns over the state of the mining sector in the province. This emerged at a regional shop stewards council meeting at Umhlathuze in Richards Bay. Num regional Secretary, Muzikayise Zakwe, says one of their concerns is that communities around mines continue to live in abject poverty. “One of the challenges that we are facing in the mining sector in KZN is the high level of unemployment and the endless road blockages in the mining companies and ambiguous social labour plans and non-compliant to [the] Mining Charter provision. As a result, local communities feel that they are not benefiting from the local mines. Zakwe says Num is concerned that the issues could result in the mining sector’s collapse. “We are calling upon government to call [an] Izimbizo with communities to address these matters as quickly as possible,” says Zakwe.
