The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) says one of their biggest challenges remains the lack of implementation of their recommendations by the police. Police Minister Bheki Cele says there’s an attempt to repair the somewhat acrimonious relationship between the IPID and the South African Police Service. IPID made a virtual presentation to the Select Committee on Security and Justice on their budget and annual performance plan for 2021/22. Cele says the relations between the two entities must be improved. “One thing we had to work on, there was some form of animosity between police and this structure. It should not be so. That’s one area we are working on, to say IPID is just working with us to get the police on an acceptable integrity posture as we work with the communities out there,” says Cele. Discussion on IPID investigations and watchdog’s relationship with SAPS:  Head of Investigations at the IPID,  Matthew Sisoko, says of the 702 cases with negative recommendations forwarded to police, less than half have been acted on. Like many other government departments and entities, IPID has been hard-hit by budget cuts due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Of 702 cases, 135 were initiated and 193 there was a DC and 374 cases, IPID is still awaiting feedback from police,” says Sisoko. #PoliceMinistry Police Minister, General Bheki Cele gives a breakdown of the Budget Vote 28, 24 & 21 for the Department of Police, IPID and The Department of the Civilian Secretariat for Police Service. #PoliceBudget ML pic.twitter.com/FEGP1lqyqg — SA Police Service  (@SAPoliceService) May 20, 2021
