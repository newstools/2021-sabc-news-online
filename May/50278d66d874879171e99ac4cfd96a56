The Second Deputy President of the Muslim Judicial Council, Sheikh Riad Fataar, has called on all political parties in South Africa to support the people of Palestine. The MJC is leading a march to parliament against the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. A number of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action while Palestinians have fired rockets targetting Israeli cities. Fataar says the suffering must come to an end. “Where’s the humility, people are dying and therefore the resistance in Palestine. We are with you, we feel the pain with you Wallahi. We are crying physical tears for what they are going through so today is but another statement from the Muslim Judicial Council and all the other people that attend the people that under occupation and are suffering there are not only Muslim.” In the video below, MJC leads march against ongoing clashes between Israel and Palestine: Palestinian rocket fire On Tuesday, Palestinians fired uninterrupted barrages of rockets into Israel, as its military pounded Gaza with air strikes through the early hours, in a dramatic escalation of clashes in Jerusalem. Explosions shook buildings throughout Gaza and rocket sirens sent Israelis in many southern towns scurrying for shelter overnight. Two Palestinians were killed and more than 100 wounded in air strike. Six Israelis were wounded by a rocket. On Monday, nine children were among the 20 dead in Gaza and scores of rockets were launched into Israel, many that were intercepted by missile defences.- Additional reporting by Reuters.
