AstraZeneca Plc may skip asking the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency-use authorisation for its COVID-19 vaccine and instead pursue the more time-intensive application for a full-fledged license to sell the shot, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. Such a step would further delay any roll-out of the British drug-maker’s shots in the United States, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday. Last week, AstraZeneca said it was working as fast as possible to compile data on its COVID-19 vaccine to apply for US approval, but that the data set was very big. The company said it planned to apply for US approval in the coming weeks. The White House said late in April that the United States would start to share up to 60 million doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine with other countries over the next few weeks. AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 shot, developed by Oxford University, has resulted in reports of rare blood clots with low platelet levels that occur more commonly in younger adults. Some countries have advised the shot be given only to older people.
