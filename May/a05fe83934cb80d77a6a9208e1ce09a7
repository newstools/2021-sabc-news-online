Pharmaceutical company Dis–chem says it is ready to administer the second phase of vaccine rollout starting from Monday. People over the age of 60, vulnerable groups, and healthcare workers are eligible to get the vaccine. Dis-chem says it will be able to accommodate hundreds of people daily and will operate 32 vaccination sites. However, people opting to use Dis-chem will pay a certain amount of money before getting their jabs through their medical aids. Government will cover the cost for those without medical aids. National Clinic Manager for Dis-chem Lizeth Kruger has urged people to register, and says walk-ins will also be accommodated. “The capacity per day that we foresee is 500 per day per vaccination site. There was a lot of planning and hard work over the last two months but we will be able to. We just want to vaccinate the health care workers that haven’t got the vaccine then we will start with the community,” says Kruger. In the audio below, Kruger outlines Dis-chem’s readiness for Phase Two of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout:  The Department of Health is hoping to have vaccinated 5 million senior citizens by the end of next month as phase two of the coronavirus vaccination programme gets underway today.
