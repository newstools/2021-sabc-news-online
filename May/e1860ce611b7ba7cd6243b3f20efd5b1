The Department of Basic Education has launched a nationwide inter-departmental anti-bullying intervention drive in schools. On Thursday, the department announced that it would partner with different departments, social partners and stakeholders for this anti-bullying intervention initiative in an effort to curb bullying involving learners, teachers and sometimes community members. The video below is about bulling at schools:  The National Assembly has held a special debate on the subject following a tragic incident in Limpopo last month. Fourteen-year-old Lufuno Mavhunga took her own life saying she could not endure the pain of being bullied. Basic Education Deputy Minister Reginah Mhaule says, “In view of the stubbornness in disrupting the vicious cycle of violence and bullying in schools, including the prevalence of abuse of alcohol and drugs in schools, we are rolling out a programme geared towards schools safety, violence and bullying prevention initiative. This programme is envisaged to be rolled out annually to raise awareness.” In the video below, government embarks on anti-bullying intervention drive in schools:
