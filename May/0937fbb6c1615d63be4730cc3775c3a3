Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has told Parliament that plans are at an advanced stage for the standardisation of assessments for grade three, six and nine. This will be accompanied by the introduction of a general education certificate before grade nine. Motshekga says this is being done to avoid pupils only encountering a standardised exam at grade twelve. “We have already produced the policy for the general education and Umalusi is in the process of evaluating it. We will be gazetting it and invite comments of the GEC certificate and it will be piloted or it will be implemented quite soon. We will keep the house updated.”
