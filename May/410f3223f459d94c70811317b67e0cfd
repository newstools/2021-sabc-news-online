The Judicial Conduct Committee (JCC) will meet next month, following a complaint against the two judges who were appointed to preside the Arms Deal Commission, Willie Seriti and Hendrick Musi. The Committee will recommend whether or not arms deal inquiry judges should be investigated. This follows a complaint against the judges, laid by two organisations, Open Secrets and Shadow World Investigations last year. The judges appointed by former President Jacob Zuma presided over the R 150 million arms deal inquiry in 2016 and found no evidence of corruption. In 2019, the High Court in Pretoria set aside the final report of the commission. The High Court found the commission had failed to undertake a full and meaningful investigation into matters falling within their terms of reference. Director of Open Secrets, Hennie van Vuuren says the commission was clearly bias. “Firstly when we consider the fact that now this month former President JZ and French arms company, Thales are in court facing charges of corruption and bribery linked to the arms deal, they were never called neither Zuma called to the stand at the commission and asked any questions whatsoever and it was very clear that there were big sways of evidence the commission clearly did not want to consider.” In the video below, Van Vuuren is interviewed on Morning Live: Final report In 2016, Zuma released the final report into the 1999 arms deal probe. Zuma releases the report below: In 1998, the South African government announced that it intended to purchase 28 BAE/SAAB JAS 39 Gripen fighter aircraft from Sweden at a cost of R10.875 billion.
