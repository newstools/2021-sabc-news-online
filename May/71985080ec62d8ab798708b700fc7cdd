The case of alleged underworld kingpin Nafiz Modack and anti-gang unit policeman, Ashley Tabisher, has been transferred to the Blue Downs Regional Court in Cape Town. The pair made a brief appearance in the Bishop Lavis Magistrates’ Court on a charge of corruption. It is alleged that Modack offered Tabisher R10 000 in exchange for information on when police would carry out operations against him. Modack also faces a slew of other charges including kidnapping, extortion, conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder of Cape Town attorney William Booth and top anti-gang unit investigator, Charl Kinnear. Defence counsel for Modack, Dirk Uys, told the court that his client, who is being held at an undisclosed location, is being made to sleep on a concrete surface and that halaal food is not being made available to him. The state had indicated that it would oppose a bail application when it is brought. In the related video below, criminal charges against alleged underworld crime boss Nafiz Modack piling up:
