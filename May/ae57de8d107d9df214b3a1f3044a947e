The African National Congress (ANC) says it has set up an appeals committee for those who want to oppose decisions of the party’s Integrity Commission. ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jesse Duarte revealed this during a media briefing on Tuesday. Duarte says there is no appeal process for the step aside rule and temporary suspension, as Section 25 of the party’s constitution did not create room for it. She has reaffirmed that the step aside resolution is not there to punish party members but to protect the party, as well as to give the accused space and time to deal with legal matters. Duarte says, “Rule 2070 under which the Secretary-General is suspended does not have an appeals components, however, any matter that goes to the Integrity Commission may ask a person to step aside. We’ve now put in place an appeals team to deal with that so the Secretary-General and others may appeal in that committee based on findings of the Integrity Commission but not on Rule 2570, it’s a clause that protects the ANC.” VIDEO: Duarte briefs the media: Magashule Suspended ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule is challenging his suspension in court next month. However, Duarte says the NWC opposes Magashule’s urgent application to set aside his suspension. “The NWC supported the application to oppose the urgent application by Magashule to set aside his temporal suspension in terms of rule 2570 of the ANC constitution. The NWC also discussed the possibility of investigating disciplinary action against some members of the ANC. I want to explain the DC process of the party without giving names because that disadvantages the people involved and l see there are names in the statement which is unfortunate.” VIDEO: Earlier this month, Magashule served Luthuli House with court papers challenging the constitutionality of the step aside resolution that resulted in his suspension.
