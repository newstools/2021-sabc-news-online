Mpumalanga Health MEC Sasekani Manzini has commended healthcare workers for assisting with the registration of the elderly in areas where there are network problems. Government started the second phase of its vaccine rollout programme on May 17. It is focussing on people who are 60 and above as well as healthcare workers who were not vaccinated in the first phase. Manzini has appealed to all those who are eligible to get vaccinated. “As a province, we are continuing with our Phase Two vaccination program. So far we are seeing an increase in terms of those registering. We can indicate that as a province we manage so far to get more than 52 000 doses. So far we are seeing an increase in the number of registration by senior citizens who are more than 82 000 but we still need to register more,” explains Manzini.
