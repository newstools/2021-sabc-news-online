Democratic Alliance Member of Parliament Phumzile Van Damme has resigned from the party. Van Damme was placed on special leave by the party in November 2020  without consultation.  “I have had a full and life-shaping journey as a Democratic Alliance (DA) activist, staff member, the longest serving National Spokesperson from 2014 to 2018, and a Shadow Minister, which I put my all into,” said Van Damme in a statement released on Thursday. Van Damme says she will not be joining another party. “To be clear, I will not be joining another political party, nor will I be using my time to launch attacks on the DA,” says Van Damme. Van Damme says she is leaving the DA “not because the DA is a so-called ‘racist party’ but because of a clique of individuals”.  I have today tendered my resignation as a DA MP.
