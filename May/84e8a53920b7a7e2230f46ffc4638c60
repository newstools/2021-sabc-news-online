As South Africa marks the anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution on Monday, President Cyril Ramaphosa says it is up to citizens to make the vision contained within it a reality. In his weekly letter to the nation, Ramaphosa says it is only by ensuring that all South Africans are able to freely and fully exercise their constitutional rights, that we will truly become a united people. President Ramaphosa says the adoption of a new democratic Constitution 25 years ago became the birth certificate of a real united nation. He says citizens and the State share a common responsibility to respect and promote the Bill of Rights contained in the Constitution with elected officials required to uphold our oaths of office and not steal resources meant to benefit citizens. Ramaphosa says South Africa must strive to be a society rooted in human dignity, equality and freedom as no system that entrenches the systematic denial of peopleâ€™s rights can be sustained.
