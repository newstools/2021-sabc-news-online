Police are investigating the cause of a fire in which a 17-year-old teenage girl and a 26-year-old woman were killed after informal structures caught alight near Belhar in Cape Town. Fire spokesperson Jermaine Carelse says a small number of dwellings were gutted in the Lloyd informal settlement in Driftsands. Carelse says, “When firefighters arrived at the scene of the fire on the corner of Symphony Way and Govan Mbeki they found several informal structures alight but managed to contain and extinguish the blaze by 3.26 am.” “Three informal structures were destroyed and the bodies of two women, aged 26 and 17 years old, were discovered among the debris. Fire Service medics declared them deceased and the scene was handed over to the South African Police Service,” Carelse explains.
