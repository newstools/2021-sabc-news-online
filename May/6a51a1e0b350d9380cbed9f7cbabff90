The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture is on Monday morning expected to question the former CEO of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) over his purchase of two properties allegedly using the agency’s money. Lucky Montana has appeared before the commission numerous times before. Various witnesses who have appeared before the commission have implicated him in the alleged wrongdoing. Montana allegedly bought two houses worth R25 million in Pretoria and Johannesburg. In 2020, the commission’s investigation gave a timeline into the suspicious property purchases Montana made while he was CEO of Prasa. One of the properties is in Pretoria, Waterkloof and was worth R11 million. It is alleged Montana used a shell company named Trade and Invest to purchase the houses through his lawyer Riaan Van der  Walt who has since left the country.
