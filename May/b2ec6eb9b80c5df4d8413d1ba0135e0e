Eskom says it has suspended load shedding this morning due to an improvement in the power system. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says over the past 24 hours Eskom teams have returned seven generation units to service. Mantshantsha says this has helped ease supply constraints and enabled Eskom to suspend load shedding until 5pm this evening. He says the power supply is not sufficient to fully supply the evening peak and stage two load shedding will therefore again be implemented from 5pm this evening until 10 pm. Mantshantsha says, “The outlook for the remainder of the week is expected to improve as Eskom teams are working tirelessly to return more generators to service. We are currently experiencing high evening peaks, which is typical of the winter demand period. Should there be any further deterioration in the generation capacity, load shedding may be necessary, most likely between 17:00 and 22:00 during the winter period.” “Eskom would like to request the public to continue using electricity sparingly as the system remains vulnerable,” added Mantshantsha.
