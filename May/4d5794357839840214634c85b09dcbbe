The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has denied claims that it cannot pay employee salaries. This comes after various media reports claiming that the Public Broadcaster could not pay April salaries. SABC Spokesperson, Mmoni Seapolelo, says the rumours are unfounded and fake. She says the SABC has also started paying out severance packages. This process is expected to be concluded shortly with the majority of payments already made. Seapolelo says the SABC is meeting and exceeding financial targets. “The SABC would like to categorically refute the allegation that it is not able to pay the salaries of its employees. The corporation has a comprehensive and established cash management process in place, that is aligned with best practices. The corporation is able to meet all its obligations when due and has, in fact, embarked on an infrastructure renewal programme, as well as significant investment in fresh and compelling content. The corporation has further managed to recover ground lost as a result of the pandemic and the state of disaster, and revenue generation is back at levels of a year ago.”
