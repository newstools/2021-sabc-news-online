The Acting Head of the Gauteng Community Safety Department, Sipho Thanjekwayo, says he is not satisfied with the way the Mamelodi East Police Station has been dealing with sexual assault cases. He visited the police station on Saturday to assess the way it has been handling cases including rape. Mamelodi East is among the top 30 Gender-Based Violence (GBV) hotspots in the country. The area also ranks among the top ten in Gauteng. Thanjekwayo says the aim of his visit to the police station is to ensure that it puts in place measures to deal with slow response time, missing dockets, a lack of feedback and police abuse of power or inaction. “The problem in this area is that the station has faced many challenges because of the poor performance of the station. So a lot of cases have not been prosecuted or arrested. So we are here really to make sure that the station improves its performance and we are hoping our presence here in the station and in the area that the station will improve its performance and make sure that when people are arrested there is proper investigation and prosecution happens.”
