The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has announced the expulsion of its mayor and four other councillors from the Mthonjaneni municipality in KwaZulu-Natal. The party’s National Council found Mayor Sibonginkosi Biyela and Councillors Eric Masikane, Tholinhlanhla Ngema, Zipho Ndlovu and Nhlonipho Buthelezi guilty of defying party instructions and violating the IFP’s constitution. The five will no longer serve as councillors. They were accused of working with African National Congress (ANC) councillors who are the opposition in Mthonjaneni. The IFP says, in a statement, it will make arrangements to have a new mayor elected.
