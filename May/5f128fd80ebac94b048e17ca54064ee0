AmaZulu King, MisuZulu kaZwelithini, has begun the process of getting married. He sent a delegation to negotiate on his behalf and pay his dowry, in isiZulu known as lobola, to the family of his queen-to-be in Newcastle, in northern KwaZulu-Natal, on Thursday. The news of the lobola being paid to the mother of the king’s children has been confirmed by AmaZulu Traditional Prime Minister, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. “For the first time, His Majesty told me that lobola cattle have been sent to Newcastle to get us a new bride and we looking forward to that,” says Prince Buthelezi. This comes days after the Zulu monarch’s Prime Minister rejected assertions that the King needed to be married to ascend the throne. The Zulu nation is expected to have a new queen:  Government officials visit the Zulu King KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, Public Protector advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane and the KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Police Commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, have visited the AmaZulu King at the KwaKhangelamankhengane Royal Palace in KwaNongoma. The Premier has said while the new AmaZulu King has been appointed in terms of cultural customs, government processes will need to be followed for a formal coronation. Zikalala also faced questions from the media about recent concerns about the security provided to the new AmaZulu monarch. He denied reports that security was withdrawn. “That unit was deployed for a temporal period; it has never been there before during the past King. It was going to be withdrawn and that happened without the consultation of the senior management of the SAPS. We checked and we realised when the matter was communicated with the management; they took a decision not to even withdraw that unit. The SAPS has always been here which is the Royal House protection in other palaces as well.” KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala briefs media following meeting with King Misuzulu kaZwelithini:  Speaking to journalists outside the palace, Mkhwebane said she had offered her condolences to the new Zulu King on the passing of his mother, the late Regent, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu in April. The regent passed on weeks after her husband’s passing.
