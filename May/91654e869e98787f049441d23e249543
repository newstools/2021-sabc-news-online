The AmaZulu Prime Minister, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi,  is making a special announcement. Last week, a meeting of the AmaZulu royal family at kwaNongoma, in northern Kwazulu Natal, descended into chaos after the reading of the will of AmaZulu regent, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu. Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu nominated her eldest son, Prince Misuzulu, as the next King of the AmaZulu Nation. In a letter dated the 23rd of March, the Queen said Prince Misuzulu Zulu ascending the throne would be subject to the royal family accepting her proposal.
