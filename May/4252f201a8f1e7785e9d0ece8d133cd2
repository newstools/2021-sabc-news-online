We must continue to reinforce the message that we all can play a part to ensure that the rise in infections does not turn into a third wave. We all know what it takes to keep the coronavirus at bay – the strict wearing of masks, sanitizing, and avoiding crowded gatherings.” Meanwhile, the Department of Health says scientists are attempting to understand the potential impact of new coronavirus variants possibly entering the country. Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize, says despite the country having been largely isolated from the possible importation of the B.1.617 variant, currently circulating in India – South Africa is investigating further measures to protect itself. The department has called on the public to continue adhering to strict COVID-19 health protocols to help avoid a third wave of infections. Manzi says the B.1.617 variant is being taken very seriously. “We also wish to reassure citizens that the threat of variants of concern like the B1617 is something that we take very seriously as government and that our scientists are working very hard to ensure that we have a good understanding of what these variants of concerns could mean for us in the context of our own country where we have a variant of concern, the B1351.” COVID-19 | No confirmed cases of the B.1.617 variant in SA to date:
