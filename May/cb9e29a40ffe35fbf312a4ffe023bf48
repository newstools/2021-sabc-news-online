The fraud and corruption case against former Eastern Cape Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba, National Council of Provinces (NCOP) member Zukiswa Ncita, African National Congress (ANC) regional chairperson Phumlani Mkolo, former Buffalo City speaker Luleka Simon Ndzele, and 11 others will resume in the East London Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. They are facing charges relating to suspected fraud involving R10 million, linked to the memorial and funeral of former President Nelson Mandela in 2013. Days after the court appearance in February, Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyabe relieved Gomba of her duties as Health MEC. Mabuyane said the decision will allow Gomba time and space to attend to the case against her: The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says R5.9 million was allegedly transferred before the former Municipal Manager, Andile Fani, halted further payment of R4.1 million. The ANC in the province has since implemented its step aside resolution against the accused individuals. NPA spokesperson, Sipho Ngwema says they are ready to take the matter to trial. “They ran a scheme which was at swindling the council following the death of former president Nelson Mandela. The matter is expected once they are done with the merits and consultations to be transferred to the High Court for a trial,” explains Ngwema. SABC’s Abongile Janjies reports that the suspects had to surrender their passports as part of the bail conditions:
