Eskom says its teams are working on returning some of its generating units back to service. The power utility started implementing Stage two loadshedding from Sunday afternoon until 10pm on Monday. Eskom Spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha says they have lost ten generating units at seven power stations. In January it was reported that South Africa was losing between R700 million and R900 million a day due to the ongoing loadshedding implemented by power utility Eskom. In the video below, Schussler says the impact of loadshedding is concerning:  This was according to calculations estimated by economist Mike Schussler. Eskom said that some generation units have yet to return to service before load shedding can be suspended. Schussler said loadshedding is costing the country dearly, “That is a cost we cannot afford right now. We can catch up with some of it, of course. But during a pandemic, it’s going to be very likely that South Africa is again going to see a decline in its GDP in the first quarter of this year, which will be tremendous load to our ability to attract investment, create jobs and to get people fed and taxes in. It is truly worrying.
