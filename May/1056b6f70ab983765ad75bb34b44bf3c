Former South African Airways board Chairperson, Dudu Myeni, is finally giving her evidence at the Commission of inquiry into state capture, in Johannesburg. Earlier, commission Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo confirmed Myeni was present and would appear virtually as instructed by the commission. Zondo had directed the secretary of the commission to lay a criminal case against Myeni after she failed to appear before the commission on Tuesday morning despite getting a summons. “There appears not have been any valid reasons for her to not to appear. The secretary of the commission must take steps to lay a criminal complaint with the South African Police service, acting in bridge of the summons and the Commission’s act.  I direct she should make herself available to give evidence today whether its via zoom or any of the methods used by her to appear virtually,” the Deputy Chief Justice said. Myeni’s legal team had been instructed to make sure she appears before the commission on Tuesday afternoon to give Eskom-related evidence. The commission has argued that Myeni cannot invoke privilege against self-incrimination without providing reasons. She is expected to give reasons to the commission on the crime she fears she will be incriminated on if she wants to remain silent. Myeni testifies in the video below:
