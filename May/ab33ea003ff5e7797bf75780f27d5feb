The case involving the owners of Lily Mine, Vantage Goldfields, business rescue practitioners and potential investors Arqomanzi will be heard virtually at the Mpumalanga High Court on Thursday. The matter was scheduled to be heard today before new affidavits were filed on behalf of a company called Lomshiyo Investment and the matter had to be postponed. In February, the High Court issued an interim order against the implementation of the amended business rescue plan. Lily Mine business rescue practitioners are accused of amending the business rescue plan without involving some of the creditors. Judge President Fracious Legodi said, “This matter will have to be heard and finalised. I want to say to you that this is the attitude of the court, we must find a way in which this matter is no longer delayed, it must be heard. My view is that I’m likely going to insist on  this matter must be attended to and finalised as soon as possible.” Workers hope to be paid outstanding monies In March, former Lily Mine employees and residents of Low’s Creek near Barberton called on the Mpumalanga High Court to set aside or fast-track the court case between owners of Vantage Goldfields, business rescue practitioners and the potential investor, Arqomanzi. The court granted Arqomanzi an interim order preventing the implementation of an amended rescue plan. Some of the former workers believe that should the court case be set aside, the new plan will be implemented and they will be paid monies owed to them by the mine. The plan was amended after mine owner, Vantage Goldfields, secured a financial deal with Australia-based company Macquarie Metals. They are also calling for the remains of the three workers who died at the mine in 2016 to be retrieved.
