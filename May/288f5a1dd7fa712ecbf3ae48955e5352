The Congress of the People is calling for the urgent intervention of Minister Zweli Mkhize and government to prevent what it calls a potential COVID-19 disaster in the Northern Cape. The latest media reports reveal that one in every four people is currently testing positive in the province which has a population of just over 1.1 million people. In the last few months, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases has warned and raised concern that the Northern Cape was the only province that never exited the second wave of COVID-19 infections. The province recently recorded a 68 percent increase in the daily infection rate in a seven-day reporting period, which is the highest in the country. COPE Spokesperson is Dennis Bloem says urgent intervention is needed. “The situation in the Northern Cape needs urgent attention. It is reported that one out of four people test positive for COVID-19. Minister Zweli Mkhize needs to urgently intervene to prevent a devastating disaster. Government cannot ignore what is happening in the Northern Cape. The people of the Northern Cape must also know that COVID-19 is also real and dangerous. Nobody must undermine this deadly enemy. It kills. We call upon people to adhere to the COVID-19 protocols, washing of hands, sanitise and exercise social distancing. Their lives are in their own hands.” The National Freedom Party is also concerned about the high infection rate in the Northern Cape. NFP Member of Parliament and member of the Health Committee in Parliament, Achmed Shaik Emam, says the matter is of great concern. “In terms of the high infection rate it’s a matter of concern. And yet this is a serious matter of concern of what is happening in the Northern Cape and the state of health care in the Northern Cape.” The latest figures from the Health Department show that the Northern Cape has almost 7780 active cases which is the second-highest in the country after Gauteng. The total number of new coronavirus cases recorded countrywide in the last reporting cycle exceeded the 4000 mark for the first time since the 3rd of February after 4234 cases were recorded.
