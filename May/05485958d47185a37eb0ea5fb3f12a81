The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it has referred two cases of misrepresentation of qualifications to the Federal Legal Commission for investigation. DA leader John Steenhuisen says party Chief Whip Natasha Mazzone has referred herself to the FLC after qualifications allegations were made about her. Steenhuisen says they are conducting a CV audit at the party. “There are two cases that have been referred to Legal Federal Commission. This is a matter of concern giving the new legislation that has been passed indicating that misrepresenting your CV is a criminal offence. “At DA we hold ourselves at a high standard. This is James Lomberg, Marious Koen from the Saldhana Municipality. Natasha Mazzone referred herself,” Steenhuisen explains. In April, Steenhuisen described claims that Mazzone has lied about her qualifications as fake news: Bonginkosi Madikizela Last month, DA Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela resigned after the party suspended him for lying about his qualifications. The qualification in question is a Bachelor of Commerce Degree in Human Resource Management. Madikizela’s biography on the Western Cape Government website says he has obtained a Bachelor of Commerce Degree in Human Resource Management and a certificate in Information Technology.
