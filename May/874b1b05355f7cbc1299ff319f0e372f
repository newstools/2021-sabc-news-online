The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it is a step closer to getting justice for thousands of South Africans who were unfairly stripped of their citizenship. The party says it presented arguments to the High Court, on Monday, on behalf of people who lost their citizenship without their knowledge. The DA is taking the Home Affairs Department to court to challenge parts of the Citizenship Act 88 of 1995 which it deems to be unconstitutional. It says a section of the Act has meant that some South Africans who apply for a second nationality automatically lose their citizenship unless they successfully apply for its retention from Home Affairs. The DA says almost two million South Africans currently live abroad. It says the court has reserved judgment on the matter.
