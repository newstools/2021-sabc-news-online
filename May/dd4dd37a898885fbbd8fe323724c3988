Former Eskom Acting Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) CEO Matshela Koko has conceded to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that his trip between to Dubai and Johannesburg was paid for by Travel Excellence in January 2016. Koko says based on the evidence, it is clear his travel arrangements had been paid for by a third party, despite him making travel bookings with Thompson Travel. Gupta linked businessman Salim Essa is alleged to have paid R100 000 to Travel Excellence for Koko’s family trip to Indonesia in 2015 and Dubai in 2016. Koko earlier said that an affidavit, claiming he used Travel Excellence and knew of them through Salim Essa, was false. ” I agree based on the evidence based upon you is that changes to my travelling plans from Indonesia, to Dubai to Jo’burg, was booked by Travel Excellence, but I booked my trip through Thompsons from Johannesburg, Indonesia, to Dubai, to Doha back to Johannesburg and my family paid for it and it’s only because of the problems of the visas that I requested the assistance of Ms Daniels,” Koko said.
