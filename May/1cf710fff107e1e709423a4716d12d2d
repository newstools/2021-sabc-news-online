The African National Congress (ANC) National Working Committee (NWC) will meet on Monday to discuss suspended secretary-general Ace Magashule’s defiance of the National Executive Committee’s (NEC) instruction to apologise to party branches for writing a letter of suspension to President Cyril Ramaphosa. Magashule wrote a letter of suspension to  Ramaphosa and also approached the High Court in Johannesburg to set aside his suspension and to declare the ANC’s step aside resolution unlawful. During the last NEC meeting, Magashule was suspended and he was given 48 hours to apologise to the ANC branches or risk further disciplinary action. Ramaphosa described Magashule’s conduct as both shocking and unprecedented. The ANC has appointed some of the country’s top legal minds to oppose Magashule’s court application. Ace Magashule not expected to apologise to ANC structures:  Magashule has vowed that he will never form a political party or leave the ANC. He says no one will ban him under a democracy nor remove the governing party from him. He was speaking outside the High Court in Pietermaritzburg last week. He was part of several high-ranking ANC officials who had gone there to support former President Jacob Zuma, who is facing fraud and corruption charges. Addressing Zuma’s supporters outside court, Magashule said: “I am going to be short because I’m banned, but I can assure you…nobody – nobody under a democracy will ban me. Nobody will remove the ANC from me. I won’t form a party, I won’t leave the ANC and I[will] die in the ANC.” Ace Magashule’s court action:
