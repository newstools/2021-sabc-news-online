Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Barbara Creecy has launched the second phase of a wildlife economy initiative in the North West. The launch took place at Koedoeberg in Groot Marico, where more than 100 game animals were donated to emerging game farmer Andrew Aphane. Creecy says the donation and loan of 354 animals to eight successful emerging game farmers and communities coincide with the commemoration of World Biodiversity Day. “In North West, window two of the game donations is supporting eight farmers. This is what we call a loan of game, so all together we are loaning 352 animals and the idea is that these animals that will be released in these farms will live here for a number of years, then reproduce.” The beneficiary of this donation, Andrew Aphane, says the donation will greatly improve the success of his business. “It is very emotional. Over 100 animal donations. It means a lot because it’s gonna play a very positive role on the balance sheet as a business and then that will give us opportunities with our financial institutions. We got Gemsbok that is Orex, Red Hartebeest, we got Giraffes and Eland.”
