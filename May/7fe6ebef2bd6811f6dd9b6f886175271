President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa will forge ahead in pushing for certain intellectual property right provisions covering COVID-19 vaccines at the upcoming 47th G7 summit. The summit will take place in the United Kingdom from  11-13 June 2021. Ramaphosa was speaking at the African National Congress (ANC) Northern Cape conference in Springbok on Saturday. “We are pushing ahead with this and fortunately our voice has been heard. I’ll be going to the G7 in a few weeks and we are going to be advocating for this,” says Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa says the COVID-19 patent waiver will empower companies in South Africa. “They have agreed so far that they will give support and so on, but we say we want more, we want the waiver because through the waiver we would be able to enable a number of companies especially black companies to come to the fore to get into this space,” Ramaphosa said.
