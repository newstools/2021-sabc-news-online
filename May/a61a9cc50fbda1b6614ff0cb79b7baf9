The public and private sectors have joined hands in the Overberg area of the Western Cape to assist flood victims in Struisbaai. The owner of a local restaurant,  Searl Derman, mobilised teams to support their affected staff, immediate families and the local community. Spokesperson Johan van Schalkwyk says they provided blankets and food to those in need and assisted the Cape Agulhas Mayor Paul Swart and his team, who set up the local community hall as a central relief point. “The Catch Cook Restaurant was also honoured to be assisted by the Western Cape Provincial Legislature Speaker Masizole Mnqasela who drove to the crisis area to lend a helping hand.  In a short address, thanking the volunteers, Masizole noted that he sees this as a human tragedy and appealed to the public to work together to help the flood relief efforts of the Catch Cook Restaurant.” Intense storms At least four people have died in three separate flood-related incidents at Bonnievale and near Riviersonderend. This after communities were affected by intense storms and heavy rainfall which several towns in the area experienced since Tuesday. A number of evacuations were also carried out in the area. The intense storms have since subsided. “Things are normalising in the Overberg, water levels are dropping, we still have road closures, especially secondary roads. Our focus is now provision of food parcels for the households that were affected by the storm,” says Overberg District Municipality Fire Chief, Reinard Geldenhuys.
