A traditional healer in Kimberley in the Northern Cape is facing allegations of abuse from his initiates. The traditional healer allegedly beat an initiate and denied food and electricity to initiates, among other things. They say they have since opened an assault case against him. They say they regret going to the healer. An initiate says, “…This whole side I was blue. I am broken, I am not pretending. People don’t know the abuse we suffer against a bo gobela.” Another says, “I wanted nothing to do with the gift because I felt failed. I even felt like my ancestors failed me by bringing me to that person. I struggled to a point where I needed toilet paper.” The accused traditional healer is said to be in hiding. His organisation maintains he is innocent. Speaking for the Traditional Healers Organisation in Kimberley, Nomvula Molusi says, “Sometimes we are a bit harsh on them but it doesn’t mean it is assault. We are going to wait for the police to come and investigate as well. If they need to question us, they are more than welcome to question us.”
