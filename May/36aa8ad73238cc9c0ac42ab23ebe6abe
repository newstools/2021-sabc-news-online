The North West Transport Investments (NTI) says it has reached an agreement with the striking North West Star Bus services employees on the 4%  increment. The workers downed tools last Thursday, demanding the 4%  salary increment and payment of their nine months outstanding provident funds. Commuters have been left stranded in the areas of Hammanskraal, Moretele and Mabopane, north of Pretoria. NTI spokesperson Freddy Sepeng says they are still finalizing the provident fund issue with the third party. “They are complaining about the old issue of provident fund, and they’re complaining again about a salary increment, but now what is happening is, when coming to salary increment the administrator signed the bargaining agreement, what I can tell you is that at the end of this month they’ll be getting their 4% salary increment, and when coming to provident fund, we are still in negotiations with Old Mutual and everything now is been consolidated. The problem will be soon solved. We are pleading to all those who are on strike to please come back to work.” Metrobus strike set to leave 30 000 commuters stranded Monday morning Meanwhile, Metrobus drivers went on strike on Monday morning.
