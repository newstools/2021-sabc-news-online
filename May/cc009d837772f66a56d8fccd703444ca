The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has welcomed the arrest of a 50-year-old teacher at Mbilwi Secondary in Thohoyandou, Limpopo. The man is accused of repeatedly raping a learner. The teacher was arrested on Friday for allegedly raping the girl, on three occasions, when she was 17 years old in 2018. The teacher allegedly offered to assist the then matriculant with extra lessons, but instead took her to a lodge where he allegedly raped her. The girl was threatened not to tell anyone and promised R30 000. She opened a case in April. Police say the suspect was eventually arrested after a lengthy probe. Discussion on psychological and physical impact of rape:  HRC’s provincial manager Victor Mavhidula says justice must be served in this case. “A s the Human Rights Commission we can confirm that we received information from one of the victims and we followed up on the information and the we decided that this matter should be refereed to the police. Indeed we are happy that there is a breakthrough and we hope justice will take its course. This matter will set a very good precedents to those teachers who will think of dating their learners,” says Mavhidula. Police spokesperson, Motlafela Mojapelo says the suspect is expected to appear at the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court on Monday on three counts of rape.
