Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has urged residents who are 60 years and older to register for Phase Two of the vaccine rollout in the province. It will start on the 17th of May. Winde says they will continue with the vaccination of health care workers until the 15th of this month. On Monday afternoon, Winde will launch the #LetsDoThis vaccination registration at the Stellcare Centre in Stellenbosch. It will be followed by door-to-door visits in the Cloetesville community. Winde says this month, they anticipate the receipt of 260 000 of the single doses of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and 135 600 of the double dosage Pfizer vaccine. Winde outlines all the different ways in which people can register for vaccination:  6/6 Covid-19 has caused so much loss over the last year.
