The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) says former Gauteng Health MEC, Dr Bandile Masuku, jumped the gun when he announced that the African National Congress (ANC) National Disciplinary Committee had cleared him and suspended Presidential Spokesperson Khusela Diko of any wrongdoing. This relates to corruption in the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Masuku was dismissed from his position in the Gauteng government after a finding of impropriety against him. The SIU earlier found that Masuku failed in his duty to conduct oversight for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) tenders. He now welcomes the committee’s decision saying it has restored his faith in the ANC and its processes. SIU spokesperson, Kaizer Kganyago, says Masuku has definitely misinterpreted the committee’s ruling. #BandileMasuku has issued statement in that NEC in relation to the #ANCNDC ruling.”Although sometimes my rights were grossly violated and I got unfair treatment,this NDC ruling is corrective” #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/MKaTboB4Gr — #TheLordOfTheMedia (@samkelemaseko) May 22, 2021  ANC Disciplinary Committee rules in favour of Dr Bandile Masuku, Khusela Diko in PPE scandal:  Audio: Bandile Masuku releases a statement saying that the SIU was wrong to paint him:
