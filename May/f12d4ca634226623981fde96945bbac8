The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) says it is impossible to control the spread of coronavirus variants around the world. Concerns have been raised after a person who had travelled from India tested positive for coronavirus in South Africa. The Health Department has reassured South Africans that there are no direct flights from India to South Africa. India has now recorded over 20-million coronavirus infections with over 222 000 COVID-19 related deaths. Acting NICD Executive Director, Prof. Adrian Puren, says people should continue observing COVID-19 health protocols. Puren says, “This (new) variant in India specifically is thought to resemble some of the aspects that are highly transmissible. We should try and monitor this particular case. But what would then be critical at this particular time is that that person is in isolation but it is really important that the contents of that particular individual are investigated in terms of levels of contact and exposure in order for us to test and isolate to try and limit transmissions. So you can’t always control the importation of variants.” In the video below, is Prof Puren full interview on Morning Live: VIDEO: Dean of the School of Nursing and Public Health at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Prof. Mosa Moshabela speaks about the lessons South Africa should consider and how the country can avoid a COVID-19 situation similar to India: VIDEO: India confirmed the presence of a new coronavirus variant in March:
