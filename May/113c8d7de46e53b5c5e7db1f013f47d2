Three security guards have been arrested for allegedly being in possession of six illegal firearms in Germiston, east of Johannesburg. Police say they spotted a Toyota Quantum full of security guards and when they stopped it, they jumped out and fled on foot. Police spokesperson Mavela Masondo says more than 40 fire firearms have been recovered in the past seven days in the province. In Silverton, Tshwane district police officers from the tracking team and crime prevention received information about a vehicle that was used in a business robbery at Spar Tsamaya road in Mamelodi. Police pounced at the suspects at their hideout on Friday. Two suspects aged 24 and 36 were apprehended while three escaped and evaded arrest.
