Former Minister of Public Enterprises, Malusi Gigaba, will continue with his Gupta-related evidence at the State Capture Commission on Monday. The commission is investigating allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector including Organs of State. Last week, Gigaba disputed allegations made by his estranged wife Nomachule that he had business dealings with the Gupta brothers. Gigaba recalled going several times to the Gupta-owned Sahara Computers offices in Johannesburg to pick up invitations. He insisted that he only had social and cultural interactions with the Guptas and not business dealings. Gigaba told Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that he continued interacting with the Guptas even after he was appointed minister. The commission hears Gupta-related evidence from Malusi Gigaba:  The commission was supposed to hear President Cyril Ramaphosa’s evidence on Monday but that appearance has since been shelved. At his next appearance – Ramaphosa is expected to give testimony for his tenure when he was the deputy president of South Africa and as the Head of State. He is also expected to make closing remarks.
