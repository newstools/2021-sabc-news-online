The case against the alleged mastermind behind the murder of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule has been postponed to 25 May 2021. Nthuthuko Shoba appeared in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court, west of Johannesburg, on Tuesday morning. The 32-year-old Shoba was arrested at his home in Florida earlier this year, after the man convicted of the murder of Pule, turned state witness. In June 2020, Pule’s body was found in an open veld in Roodepoort. She was eight months pregnant at the time. Shoba was arrested earlier this year and has twice been denied bail.  On Tuesday his lawyer brought an application stating that if he was transferred to Johannesburg Prison he would not be safe. He claimed the threats were allegedly from Muzikayise Malephane, his co-accused. The matter was postponed to 25 May 2021 for the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court to deal with the security concerns raised. Shoba will appear in the High Court for a pre-trial on 28 May 2021.
