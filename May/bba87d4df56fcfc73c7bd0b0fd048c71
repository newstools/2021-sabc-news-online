As a cold front moves into Gauteng on Saturday morning, the City of Johannesburg has urged residents not to leave heating devices unattended to avoid fire incidents. This follows a warning from the South African Weather Service that most parts of Gauteng will experience a significant drop in temperatures on Saturday and Sunday. City of Johannesburg Emergency Management Service spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi has appealed to residents in informal settlements to be vigilant. “From our side as the City of Johannesburg Emergency Management Services, we will remain on high alert so that we can be able to respond to any emergency which might occur throughout the weekend.”
