SAPS urgently addressing DNA evidence sample backlogs: Last month Police Minister, Bheki Cele, said the problem of DNA evidence sample backlogs at the National Forensic Science Laboratory was being urgently addressed. Cele said a government IT company had been appointed to track and trace samples. He said the samples were traced manually in the past, but the new digital system is able to trace seven to 8 000 samples a week. Police management told Parliament’s portfolio committee recently that backlogs at the National Forensic Science Laboratory stood at over 173 000 cases.
