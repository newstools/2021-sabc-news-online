The latest crime statistics show an increase in murder and attempted murder in the first three months of 2021. Police Minister Bheki Cele released the quarterly crime statistics in Pretoria on Friday afternoon. The statistics show the crime levels during the time when the country was under Lockdown Level 3 and Adjusted Level 1 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although contact crimes have shown an overall decrease, Cele says it’s worrisome that more people died during this time compared to the same period last year. Alcohol and drugs have been cited as contributing factors to most contact crimes. He says the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal have recorded the most increases in murders. “4 976 People were killed in the first three months of 2021. This is 387 and more people killed compared to the corresponding period in the previous financial year. Mpumalanga province recorded the same; it is joined by Limpopo, Free State and Northern Cape in recording some form of decrease in murder cases. However, it is concerning that EC and KZN recorded double-digits increases standing at 21.5% and 16.9 % respectively,” adds the Minister.
