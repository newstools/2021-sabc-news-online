The Free State Health Department says one of the hospitals in Bloemfontein is already full of COVID-19 patients. The department says it is concerned about the increasing confirmed numbers of COVID-19 cases. It says this will result in unnecessary pressure on the healthcare system. On Saturday, the province recorded 523 new cases, a significant increase from previous reported daily cases.

The hospital’s Clinical Manager Dr Franco Erasmus says they have a dedicated Intensive Care Unit for acute patients. Erasmus also says since the start of the pandemic, the hospital has treated more than 1 800 patients. “We have seen an increase in numbers the last couple of weeks. The curve isn’t that steep as the second and first wave but we had to open another ward as well an ICU to deal with extra cases, in the last couple of weeks, especially after the Easter weekend,” says Erasmus. COVID-19 reinfections Erasmus adds that there have been cases of patients who were re-infected with COVID-19. “Yes, we definitely see staff members as well as patients that have COVID-19 again. Luckily after they had it the first time or in the case of the healthcare workers, after they have been immunized, the second time isn’t that severe so the symptoms are much less when they had it the first time,” says Erasmus. The Mangaung region has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the Free State. Some residents say the public is not doing much to assist in fighting the disease. “I can see the people are not complying, not wearing masks, they are not sanitizing and as a citizen of Bloemfontein, I’m going to take the vaccine because I think is very important,” says a resident. “I’m going to take a vaccine. I’m feeling well but I would like to urge everyone to put their masks and sanitize every time because the president says if we don’t do that we would end up in level five again,” says another resident. President Ramaphosa raises concern about a possible third wave of coronavirus infections in SA:  COVID-19 surge The Free State Health Department says they are already receiving large volumes of COVID-19 patients. Department Spokesperson Mondli Mvambi says the number of positive COVID-19 cases has been on the increase from the beginning of the month. “In the Free State, we have seen from around the 6th of May that we had already indicated that we are now venturing into a third wave status. And declared that because we wanted risk communication and community engagement, to inform behaviour change amongst our people so that people do not become relaxed. They know that they must prevent COVID-19, it’s a personal responsibility for everyone to curb the surge of cases,” says Mvambi. More than 61 000 elderly people have registered in the province for the second phase of vaccination. Understanding how COVID-19 vaccines work: Dr Kerrin Begg
