The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) is alerting the public via a scrolling message which is appearing on its television channels, SABC 1, 2 and 3, broadcast through analogue transmitters, about the impending analogue switch off and the need to change to alternative digital technologies for viewing. This is in keeping with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement during this year’s State of the Nation Address (SONA), wherein he stated that all analogue transmissions will be switched off by April 2022. “The message will only appear on analogue television platforms and not on any of our digital platforms (i.e. DTT, DTH, DSTV, OVHD and OTT platforms,” the SABC said in a statement. The scrolling message reads as follows: “Important notice: If you see this message go to your nearest Post Office to register for a free government subsidised decoder or call 0860 736 832 to continue receiving a television broadcast,” said the public broadcaster in a statement. The public will be informed as and when new developments occur.
