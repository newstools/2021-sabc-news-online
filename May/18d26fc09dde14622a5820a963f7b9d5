Former Chief Financial Officer at Transnet, Anoj Singh, is expected to return to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg on Friday morning to complete his testimony. On Thursday, Singh denied that he was neither incompetent nor party to the Gupta family’s looting of around R3.5 billion from Transnet. Singh says he was not aware that Gupta-associate, Salim Essa, was earning kick-backs through McKinsey’s agreement with Transnet. “Mr. Chair if it comes to my incompetence or otherwise, I would suggest saying that it is not incompetence on my part, if it was incompetence on my part I would say that Mr. Molefe would have said that when he came and gave evidence and I don’t think he actually indicated in any way, shape or form that was the case. Secondly Mr. Chair, in terms of it being my incompetence, at the end of the day these transactions were not approved by me alone, I did not originate these transactions alone, nor did I approve these transactions alone. You see there is evidence that you may have been involved with the Guptas more than you would like me to believe you were.” Singh’s testimony comes days after international consulting agency McKinsey agreed to pay back R870 million in consulting fees it earned from Transnet. Meanwhile, the Presidency released a statement indicating that President Cyril Ramaphosa will not appear before the commission next week as scheduled for May 31 and June 1. His appearance before the commission will be rescheduled. Commission hears Transnet-related evidence: Anoj Singh
