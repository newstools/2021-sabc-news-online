Eskom’s two major unions, the National Union of Mineworkers (Num) and the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) are set to hold a joint media briefing to update the public on ongoing wage negotiations on Thursday. The unions are demanding a salary increase of between 9% and 19%, while the power utility has offered a 1.5% wage increase subject to unions agreeing to forgo certain benefits. Both the Num and Numsa have rejected Eskom’s offer. Public sector unions still mulling over government’s 1.5% wage increase offer  Unions shoot down offer Earlier, acting General Secretary of Num, William Mabapa said, “There’s no offer on the table. What has been given is a joke. It’s a 1.5% that is conditional.” The National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) says their members will not entertain any offer below the consumer price inflation, currently sitting at 3.2%. “Eskom is playing with us, 1.5% which is below inflation. It’s not even a starter for our discussions. We told them that we’re not accepting the 1.5. We can only talk about them making an offer if the 1.5 is above inflation,” says Numsa’s chief negotiator Vuyo Bikitsha. Unions to brief public on Eskom wage negotiations
