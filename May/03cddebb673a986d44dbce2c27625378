Some learners at Cornwall Hill College in Centurion, Pretoria, have spoken out about prevailing racism in the school. They say this is affecting their schooling experience. Learners and parents gathered for a mass protest on Monday morning, calling for an end to racism and the slow pace of transformation at the prestigious school. These include among others, the language and hair policy, sporting codes and lack of representation of teaching staff and the board. Gauteng Education MEC Panayza Lesufi met the school’s leadership on Monday and promised racism would no longer happen under his watch.  Two matriculants say they hope things will change. “These experiences and the things we are saying … they stem from places where when you always have to come to school, [you have] to mentally prepare yourself for the things you have to endure as a black child. There have been people that have been called the K-word.” “It once occurred to a girl [fellow pupil] who was walking down from practice and a white parent said to her you are quite a rude Kword. They [school] said that no dreads were allowed at the school and I’ve had dreads since 2008 and I’ve had to live with that rules and brought across an identity crisis for myself.” In the video below, Cornwall Hill College protest against racism:  The school is also accused of ignoring complaints that parents and learners had submitted in a memorandum early in 2020.
