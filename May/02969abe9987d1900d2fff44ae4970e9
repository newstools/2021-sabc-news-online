More than 18 000 people have registered to vote in by-elections in four municipalities in the Mpumalanga province. The newly appointed Provincial Electoral Officer, Gugu Langa, says there were no major challenges reported in all the voting stations. “So far, everything is going smooth in all the four municipalities. Stations opened on time and there is no incident that has been reported. Voter turnout is quite very good. The by-elections that took place on the 21st of April and the ones that are currently running today are an indication and also a dry run that we will be safe.” Video: IEC pleased with the voting process  The community of Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga is still battling with the provision of clean drinking water and other service delivery problems. Despite this, residents continued to take part in the by-election held in Ward 21 at Buffelshoek near Acornhoek. The ward became vacant following the resignation of a councillor who was a member of the Better Residence Association. Currently, the ward is being contested by the African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). The voters have called on those who will be elected to prioritise the basic needs of the community. “We are suffering a lot in this area. We do not have clean water. We are forced to buy potable water,” says one voter. “I am casting my vote with a hope that things will change in our community. But we need water more than anything else,” says another voter.
