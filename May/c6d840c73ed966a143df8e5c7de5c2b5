Efficient service delivery is under threat as a wage dispute looms between public sector workers’ unions and the government. This as wage negotiations between the two parties deadlocked at the Bargaining Council. In the fourth round of wage talks on Monday, unions refused to move from their demands and the government from its offer. The video below is reporting that public sector wage negotiations are on a knife edge:  The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has been brought in to assist the parties to reach a consensus. The current round of wage negotiations began over two months ago with various unions tabling a joint demand of a 7% wage increase. They hit a deadlock last month with government maintaining that it simply has no money to increase salaries at all for the next three years. The Congress of South African Trade Union’s (Cosatu) chief negotiator for public sector unions, Mugwena Maluleke says an agreement is not yet in sight. “We are still from that particular process because on Sunday we started full-blown facilitation…yesterday [Monday] and today [Tuesday]. So we will see how far we are today and make an assessment again tomorrow [Wednesday]. We are hoping the employer will put a revised offer today or by the latest tomorrow because the clock is ticking,” explains Maluleke.
