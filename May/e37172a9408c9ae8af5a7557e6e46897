Algeria will reopen air and land borders on June 1, but strict measures will be imposed to limit the spread of the coronavirus, the presidency said on Sunday. Only five flights a day from and to Algerian airports will be allowed “with full adherence to strict precautions”, it said in a statement after a cabinet meeting chaired by President Abdelmadjid Tebboune. More details would be announced in a week, it added. Algeria closed borders and suspended all flights in March 2020 when the number of COVID-19 infections started to increase, but domestic flights resumed in December last year. The North African country has so far recorded 125 311 coronavirus cases, including 3 374 deaths. In April Algeria said it will start producing Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine in September in partnership with Moscow, and part of the production will be intended for African countries. The North African country, which already has received 50 000 doses of Sputnik V, said in February it was in talks with Russia to produce the vaccine. “We must meet the vaccine challenge. We will be ready to produce an Algerian vaccine in September,” Lotfi Benbahmed, the minister, said on state radio. The vaccine will be produced in partnership with state pharmaceutical products firm Saidal in the eastern city of Constantine, Benbahmed said. Saidal will get help from a”leading Indian laboratory specialised in the manufacture of vaccines”, Benbahmed added, without naming the laboratory. “Three committees are working on the transfer of the technology provided by the Russian side,” Benbahmed said.”Algeria will have its share and responsibility in the vaccination of the African populations.”
