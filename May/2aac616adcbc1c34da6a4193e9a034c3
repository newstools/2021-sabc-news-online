Gauteng Premier David Makhura has called on members of the AmaZulu royal family to be resilient in light of the death of the regent of the AmaZulu nation, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu. Her body will be transported from the Johannesburg mortuary, on Wednesday, to her hometown of KwaNongoma in KwaZulu-Natal. The Queen died in the Milpark hospital in Johannesburg on Thursday last week at the age of 65. The Queen will be buried at the Kwakhangelamankengane Palace in Nongoma on Thursday. Makhura says the AmaZulu nation should remain strong. “It is indeed sad that we have lost the Queen regent –  her majesty-immediately after losing the king. But I think as I say all as a people is to do is to wish the Zulu royal house strength and resilience and we are hoping that they will be able to pull through in these difficult times,” says Makhura.
