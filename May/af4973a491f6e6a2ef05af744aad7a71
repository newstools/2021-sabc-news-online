Ministerial Advisory Committee Co-chairperson, Koleka Mlisana, says South Africa should remain on high alert regarding the coronavirus variants circulating both in the country and abroad. The death toll from COVID–19 related complications in South Africa is approaching 55 000. There are concerns that the country could experience a substantial third wave of the virus. Mlisana says it’s important for people not to drop their guard against the coronavirus. The Department of Health has confirmed that variants of the COVID-19 virus first identified in the UK and India have been detected in South Africa. The country has at least four cases reported of variants, with two in Gauteng and two in KwaZulu-Natal.  They are all believed to have traveled from India. While the numbers are small, many people are concerned that if not properly managed this may pose a greater risk for the country.
