President Cyril Ramaphosa has assured MPs that the days of State Capture are over. Ramaphosa was answering questions during a hybrid sitting of the National Assembly. He was responding to an answer from Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, John Steenhuisen, on whether he would support a draft bill submitted by the party to bring an end to cadre deployment. But Ramaphosa says cadre deployment is a worldwide phenomenon. “All parties, including DA, make political appointments. But I assure you we are working on professionalising the administration. Days of state capture are over.” President Cyril Ramaphosa is answering questions in the National Assembly:  Meanwhile, the Chief Whip of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Floyd Shivambu, has questioned why President Cyril Ramaphosa is answering questions in the National Assembly. Shivambu wanted to know whether Ramaphosa is mandated to address the House as a deployee of his party, seeing that it has been reported that he has been suspended. But Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli, assured MPs that Parliament has not been notified of any changes. “I was waiting to hear who was gonna answer questions. We are representing parties and the info we have is that Mr Ramaphosa is suspended by the party that deployed him here? Tsenoli responds: “Order. This is parliament we have not received any thing we don’t know what you’re talking about. We are here to listen to President and that is what is going to proceed.” On Wednesday night, a statement coming from the African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general, Ace Magashule suspended ANC president, Cyril Ramaphosa.
