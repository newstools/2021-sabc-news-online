Former acting Eskom group chief executive officer Matshela Koko and former State Security Minister David Mahlobo are scheduled to testify at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Commission hears Eskom-related evidence: Matshela Koko  On Tuesday, co-owner of travel agency, Travel Excellence, Halima Allana told the commission that Gupta-associate Salim Essa made many travel bookings for high-profile clients between 2013 and 2018. Allana said she had no reason to lie about the bookings Essa made and initiated through her agency for top executives of state-owned enterprises and some ministers. She indicated that these included former Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane. Travel Excellence told the commission that it fell out of favour with Essa last year and has not had any contact with him since. Allana said, “We got quite a few referrals from Salim Essa and the Gupta’s and from other clients that we then built a client base for Travel Excellence. For example, I don’t know who Mr Zwane is, but there were some names that I didn’t know were ministers or high profile people because we were given names and were told book. So I wouldn’t know if I was booking for government or a high-profile person. But come later than I realise this was a high profile person.” Video: State Capture Inquiry | Matshela Koko testifies
