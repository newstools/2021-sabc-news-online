The South African Weather Service has issued weather warnings for an intense cold front expected to make landfall on the Western Cape coast on Wednesday. Cape Town Disaster Risk Management spokesperson, Charlotte Powell says all City services and external agencies will be on standby to deal with the predicted adverse weather conditions, which could include strong to gale force winds, rain and rough seas. “We remind residents to please clear out any potential blockages around their homes and ensure that gutters and downpipes are clear. In low-lying areas, please dig a trench around your home if possible, to allow water to run off and reduce the risk of localised flooding. For any weather-related service requests or emergencies, residents are advised to call the City’s Public Emergency Communication Centre.” Media Release: Cut off low to cause adverse weather conditions over parts of the Western Cape (05-06 May 2021). pic.twitter.com/vbAl2WPGVW — SA Weather Service (@SAWeatherServic) May 4, 2021  A cut off low will result in heavy rainfall, strong winds and rough sea conditions over parts of the Western Cape from Wednesday (05 May) (especially in the evening) into Thursday. pic.twitter.com/tcI1ZRqoKc — SA Weather Service (@SAWeatherServic) May 4, 2021
