The Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation (CSVR) says mob justice in South Africa can only be stopped by efficient and functioning law enforcement agencies. This week, four people were killed and five severely injured in a mob justice attack in Honeydew, west of Johannesburg. It is alleged that about 200 people from the Zandspruit informal settlement attacked a group of nine boys they suspected of robbing people in the area. The centre’s executive director, Nomfundo Mogapi has urged members of the public not to take the law into their own hands. “The criminals have become more violent. We need to go back to discuss law enforcement. For the longest time, the focus in our country has been on giving us more police but we are realising that is not just about the increase of police.” “It’s the functioning of the police institution. It is having the kind of leadership that is able to create an institution that is functional that ensures that the police are performing,” explains Mogapi.
