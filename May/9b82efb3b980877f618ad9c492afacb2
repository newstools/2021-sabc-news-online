The Hawks have arrested two high-ranking police officers for alleged human trafficking and defeating the ends of justice. A brigadier and a captain based in Vereeniging, in the Vaal, are accused of raping a woman who had been kidnapped and taken to a brothel. The officers’ identity has been concealed until they appear in court. The Hawks say the officers are part of a human trafficking syndicate. They launched an investigation following an anonymous tip-off from nursing staff at a hospital. A young woman had been brought in following a botched abortion performed by a doctor linked to the brothel. The officers were arrested after the victim, who has been taken to a place of safety, reported the matter. “Allegations on this matter; victims were kept hostage or against their will at an illegal brothel in the Vereeniging area where they would usually be drugged against their will and sedated,” says Hawks Spokesperson, Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu. The Hawks say the police officers raped the woman, despite being aware that her mother had opened a missing person’s case. They also allegedly tried to mislead investigators by advising the victim to open a fictitious case against a family member. The two are alleged to have frequented the brothel and even told the victim about the missing person’s case. “This is a level five investigation where the priority is on a higher level and on this matter, we are dealing with a senior police officer who is a brigadier and also captain who alleged to have been involved in trafficking person allegations rape as well defeating the ends of justice,” Captain Mulamu says. The state will oppose bail on fears the high-ranking police officers will interfere with the investigation. More arrests are imminent.
