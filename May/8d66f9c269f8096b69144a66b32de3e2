A meeting of the AmaZulu royal family at kwaNongoma, in northern Kwazulu Natal, has descended into chaos after the reading of the will of AmaZulu regent, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu, in which she proposed that her oldest son, Prince Misizulu Zulu ascend the throne. In a letter dated the 23rd of March, the Queen said Prince Misuzulu Zulu ascending the throne would be subject to the royal family accepting her proposal. Police had to hastily escort Prince Misuzulu, his siblings and the Traditional Prime Minister, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi from the tent where the will was being read. As our SABC News Ayanda Mhlongo reporting on the scene, chaos erupts following the announcement of preferred AmaZulu King: Forty-six-year old Prince Misuzulu Zulu kaZwelithini is the oldest son of King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu and Queen Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu. Queen Mantfombi said Prince Misuzulu is the oldest son she bore the King, and that he descends from both the AmaZulu royal house as well as the Eswatini royal family. Prince Zulu will have to accept the nomination, failing which, any of his brothers could be the next king by vote, through secret ballot.
