Political analyst Susan Booysen says this week is a definitive one for the African National Congress (ANC) as the  National Working Committee plans to deal with two important issues when it meets on Monday. She says one issue is of suspended secretary-general Ace Magashule’s defiance of the National Executive Committee’s (NEC) instruction to apologise to party branches for writing a letter of suspension to ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa. During the last NEC meeting, Ace Magashule was suspended and he was given 48 hours to apologise to the ANC branches or risk further disciplinary action. Ramaphosa says ANC’s NEC will deal with his letter of “suspension”:  Booysen says the other issue is the National Disciplinary Committee’s decision to overturn the suspensions of Bandile Masuku and Khusela Diko from the Gauteng provincial executive committee. This after finding the two not guilty of neither contravening the ANC’s constitution nor unethical behaviour related to corruption in the procurement of Personal Protective Equipment. Booyens says it will be interesting to see what the outcome of Monday’s meeting will be. “The National Working Committee will be meeting to deliberate on Magashule and other cases as well. It is really a week that we will look at the ANC whether it is planning to take definitive action,” says Booyens. Former Gauteng Health MEC Dr Bandile Masuku on a quest to have his name cleared:
