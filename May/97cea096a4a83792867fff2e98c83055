Shooting in Texas in April Last month, a gunman opened fire at the cabinet-making business in Texas where he worked, killing one person and wounding six others before he was taken into custody in the latest of several mass shootings in the United States. Four of those wounded in the shooting rampage at Kent Moore Cabinets in Bryan, Texas, were in critical condition in hospital, the police department said on Twitter at the time. The suspect was not immediately identified, although Bryan police said he worked at Kent Moore Cabinets. Investigators said they did not yet know what motivated the deadly outburst of workplace violence. Mass shooting in March Police publicly identified the suspect accused of killing 10 people – including a policeman – in a hail of bullets at a Colorado supermarket, marking the second deadly US mass shooting in a week and adding to the state’s tragic history of lethal gun violence, it was reported in March. The affidavit also said law enforcement databases show Alissa purchased a Ruger AR-556 pistol, a weapon that resembles a semi-automatic rifle, on March 16, six days before the shooting.
