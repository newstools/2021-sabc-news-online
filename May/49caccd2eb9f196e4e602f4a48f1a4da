The Commission of Inquiry Into State Capture, on Tuesday, announced that it will end its oral hearings next week. The Commission’s Chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, says they had hoped to finalise oral evidence at the end of March, and were working around the clock to make this possible. He says he will make exceptional hearings, where possible, and will apply to the High Court for a limited extension to finalise the Commission’s report. Zondo says it was important that high-ranking officials in State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), where there are serious allegations of corruptions and state capture, are given the time to complete their evidence. The last witness will be President Cyril Ramaphosa who will appear before the Commission on 31 May 2021 and on 1 June 2021. Deputy Chief Justice Zondo says the Commission is mindful of the fact that there are some applications for leave to cross-examine. He says the  Commision can make  exceptions and  some witness may still be called.  Video| State Capture Inquiry : 25 May 2021
