A total of four mountain passes have been closed in the Eastern Cape due to snowfalls and inclement weather. The affected passes are the Wapadsberg Pass in Cradock, Barkly Pass between Elliot and Barkly East, Lootsberg Pass between Graaff-Reinet and Middleburg, and also the Penhoek Pass on the N6 between Queenstown and Aliwal North. The cold weather has also hit parts of the interior and the mercury is set to drop further in cities like Johannesburg and Pretoria. Eastern Cape Transport Department spokesperson, Unathi Binqose, has urged motorists to avoid roads in high lying areas. “Penhoek Pass, in particular, is closed, not only due to the snowing and but also because two trucks have jackknifed in that area and bringing the flow of traffic to a complete halt and even making it difficult for authorities to move around in that area. Authorities and rescue personnel, are there to try and get those trucks back on the road again.” @SAWeatherServic @StormReportSA1 Rhodes, Eastern Cape this morning pic.twitter.com/mdk9dZMCp3 — Theuns Jonck (@TheunsJonck) July 13, 2021  Media Release: Wet, windy and very cold conditions from Monday (12 July 2021).
