The International Relations minister, Dr. Naledi Pandor, has conveyed her condolences to the family of former KwaZulu-Natal Premier and former Eskom board Chairperson Dr. Ben Ngubane. Ngubane passed on in the early hours of Monday morning from COVID-19 complications after two weeks at a KwaZulu-Natal hospital. Pandor says Ngubane, who became the first Arts and Culture minister in 1994 played a pivotal role in the construction of South Africa’s science and technology firm foundation. Spokesperson, Clayson Monyela, says her thoughts and prayers are with Ngubane’s family during the bereavement. “When I become Minister of Science and Technology in 2009, I had the pleasure of benefitting from the solid foundation that Dr. Ngubane and my other predecessors had put in place.  It made it easy for us to focus on speeding up the implementation of the projects they had started. South Africa owes a debt of gratitude to Dr. Ngubane for pioneering our science and technology. Minister Pandor said her thoughts and prayers are with Dr. Ben Ngubane’s family during this time of bereavement.”
