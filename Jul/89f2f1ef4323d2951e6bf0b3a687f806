The High Court in Johannesburg will hand down judgment in the case between the African National Congress (ANC) and its suspended Secretary-General Ace Magashule on Friday morning. Last month, Magashule had asked the court to lift his suspension for failing to vacate his position following a directive under the ANC’s step-aside resolution. According to the resolution, criminally charged party members should step aside from their positions until their cases are concluded. Magashule is facing fraud and corruptions charges in the High Court in Bloemfontein relating to a R250-million asbestos project while he was premier of the Free State. In his court application, Ace Magashule relied on the 2012 Constitutional Court ruling, which held that a court can declare a decision of a political party invalid if it is inconsistent with both the Constitutions of the party and the country. He wanted his suspension by the ANC on the 5th of May, to be declared unlawful, invalid and unconstitutional, while asking the court to find the suspension letter he issued to party President Cyril Ramaphosa as valid. Magashule also argued that the ANC step-aside guidelines agreed by its NEC earlier this year are in breach of the party’s constitution and that of the country. He said the ANC step-aside rule was tailored to selectively target him, because he serves as a threat to President Ramaphosa’s likely bid for re-election as ANC leader, at the party’s elective conference next year.
