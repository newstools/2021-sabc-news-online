Warrants of arrest have reportedly been issued against two members of parliament at Eswatini, Bacede Mabuza and Mduduzi Simelane. Mabuza and Simelane, also known as Magawugawu, are among those who are advocating for democracy in Eswatini. Their legal representative, Thulani Maseko, has confirmed that the warrants of arrest have been issued, however, they have not yet been arrested. Maseko says, “Our understanding between me and the clients is that as soon as they get the court process, they will give me a call. Then I will make my way wherever they will be and then begin to trigger the legal system.” “We don’t know the basis of the warrant of arrest at the moment. Our plan is to then approach the court to have them released either on bail. These are people who are well known in Swaziland (Eswatini) and we believe they have not committed any crime so the court should be able to release them,” added Maseko.
