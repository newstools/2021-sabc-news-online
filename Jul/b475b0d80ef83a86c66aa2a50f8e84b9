Cape Town Police say no further incidents of taxi-violence-related shootings have been reported overnight and on Thursday morning on the Cape Flats. On Wednesday, an alleged conflict between rival associations Cata and Codeta led to seven fatal shootings of taxi operators in various places, these included Bellville, Ravensmead, Du Noon and Phillipi East. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk says minibus-taxis are not operating on Thursday morning in the Khayelitsha area. “Van Wyk says there has so far this morning been no incidents reported in the Khayelitsha, Blue Downs and Tygerberg clusters of the police. He says police members have been deployed on hotspot taxi routes to monitor any developments. Seven people killed in an ongoing feud between warring taxi associations:  Meanwhile, a meeting is planned between Cata and Codeta in Cape Town. The meeting has been called by the provincial Department of Transport. Taxi ranks are deserted in several areas of the Cape Flats including Khayelitsha as operators were informed to stay at home, leaving commuters struggling for transport. Codeta spokesperson Andile Kanyi says they don’t know yet who’s shooting who. Kanyi says, “Five drivers were shot and three of them passed away, but two of them were lucky, they survived so now we have decided as Codeta that let us stop operations at this point in time because we don’t know what is going on, because we know at the end of the day the drivers are also very important and the shooting is only taking place to the drivers.”
