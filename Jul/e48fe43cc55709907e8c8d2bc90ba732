The KwaZulu-Natal Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development Department has declared several municipalities in the province as hotspots for the current outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The department has noted a spike in numbers that has forced authorities to restrict the movement of cloven-hoofed animals. Department spokesperson Dr Bontle Modisane says, “We would prefer that hooved animals not be moved out of the declared zones if there is a need for movement, especially if it is not for slaughter purposes. It should be done after the animals have been properly inspected to make sure that this is not prevalent in those animals that are being transported. Movement other than slaughter will be strictly controlled to prevent the spread to other areas.” In the video from December 2019, Minister Didiza speaks about the outbreak in Limpopo at the time:  At least three district municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal have been declared disease management areas after an outbreak and spread of Foot and Mouth disease which was first discovered in May at the Umkhanyakude District Municipality. The virus strain has been identified as a FMD SAT2. However, economists have raised concerns over the biosecurity challenges in the Livestock and Poultry sectors. The Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, Thoko Didiza, says the origin of the outbreak is still under investigation. “It is important for us to contain the movement of animals and meat in these areas,” says Thoko Didiza.
