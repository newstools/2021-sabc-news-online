Some Gauteng-bound truckers from Beit Bridge Border in Limpopo have parked en route to Gauteng as they fear possible attacks and violence. The truck drivers told SABC News that they will stay where they are until the situation has calmed down. “We heard that there is violence there so we are a bit concerned because we are staying here, we are parked here until further notice. I am just waiting until, I will wait here until the situation is calmed. We are looking for the SA government to be involved to silence the violence,” one of them said. Businesses in parts of Gauteng and KZN continue to bear the brunt due to sporadic looting:  Government has deployed the army to violence hotspots in a bid to quell the violence. On Monday night, President Cyril Ramaphosa cautioned that the disregard of COVID-19 protocols by South Africans, who have gone on the rampage calling for former president Jacob Zuma’s release from prison, could see a surge in infections. On the other hand, the Independent Community Pharmacy Association (ICPA) also warned that the violence and looting in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng will further delay the country’s vaccination rollout programme. The association says independent pharmacies are among the shops looted and medication worth millions of rand have been stolen or destroyed. It’s urged government to post soldiers at pharmacies to protect their stock. Full statement below:
