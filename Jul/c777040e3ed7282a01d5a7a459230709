The National Chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC), Gwede Mantashe, says the current violence, looting, and vandalism that has gripped parts of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal has nothing to do with former president Jacob Zuma. Speaking to the media at the Chris Hani Mall in Vosloorus, Mantashe says these are thugs who are seeing an opportunity to loot. The mall has been a scene of chaos since Sunday with hundreds of looters breaking into the mall and leaving it in complete ruins. ANC officials in Vosloorus to assess the situation, appeal for calm  Meanwhile, ANC Chief Whip in the National Assembly, Pemmy Majodina, has called an emergency meeting of the party’s caucus tomorrow. The meeting is in response to the current outbreaks of violence and looting in some parts of the country. The party is calling on its public representatives to join in efforts to quell the disturbances in their communities. Majodina’s spokesperson Nomfanelo Kota says they expect the ANC caucus to condemn the acts of lawlessness and chaos around the country. “But also well call on those public representatives, the MPs themselves to be on the ground, to interact with our communities and the work together with civil society as well as law enforcement agencies. To call for calm, to ensure a cessation of hostilities, and to make sure that we do not lose jobs. We save jobs, we save our economy we save the future of our country.” Spread of coronavirus Earlier on Wednesday Correctional Services Minister, Ronald Lamola, said he is concerned about the spread of the coronavirus as over 1000 people have been arrested since violent protests and looting broke out in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.
