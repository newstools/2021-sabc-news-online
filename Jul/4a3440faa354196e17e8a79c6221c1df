Police officers have reportedly come under attack from protestors – as looting and the vandalism of stores continues in Diepkloof, Soweto, in Gauteng. Protestors took to the streets at the weekend, demanding the release of former president Jacob Zuma – after his incarceration last week. The demonstrations have morphed into mass looting and vandalism, mostly in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. A police officer was injured in a Soweto shopping mall while trying to restore law and order. An ambulance subsequently came to his aid as the pelting of stones and looting continued. Looking at law enforcement, policing and public security amid the unrest with David Bruce:   Residents have again flooded to the malls and are continuing to go into the shops and take whatever it is that they want. There has been a scuffle between the looters and residents who don’t want the crime to continue. In Ekurhuleni, east of Johannesburg, scenes of destruction at the Sam Ntuli Mall are a stark reminder of the overnight looting that has left all shops completely cleaned out and banks broken into and ATMs completely destroyed. According to private security guards at the mall, the looting began on Monday night just after 8pm and continued to the morning, leaving behind a trail of destruction. – Additional reporting by Sipho Kekana The latest from Katlehong with Maageketla Mohlabe:
