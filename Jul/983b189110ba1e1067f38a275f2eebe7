Leader of the Ngwane National Liberation Congress in Eswatini, Sibongile Mazibuko, says the arrest warrants issued against two members of Eswatini’s parliament are aimed at silencing those who are calling for democracy. According to reports, the warrants were issued against Bacede Mabuza and Mduduzi Simelane. Last week, pro-democracy groups embarked on violent protest action. They set buildings alight and looted several shops. Mazibuko has accused King Mswati III of using his power to threaten those who are calling for change in Eswatini. “The warrant of arrest is to continue silencing members of parliament that are speaking the truth like he has been doing for the last 50 years. He is ready to kill and it is another way to maintain the status quo, because as I have said- he continues to derive his financial benefits from the continued status quo,” she alleges. The government of Eswatini is yet to respond to the allegations. A Southern African Development Community (SADC) delegation is in the land-locked kingdom on a fact-finding mission. The regional body has called for dialogue to resolve the ongoing impasse in the tiny kingdom. Discussion on SADC’s return to Eswatini as pro-democracy civil groups raise red flags:
