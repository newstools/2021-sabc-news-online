Eskom says the national grid is under severe pressure and has appealed to people to turn off non-essential appliances. This comes as temperatures plummet in many parts of the country and people rely on heaters to stay warm. The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has warned that wet, windy, and cold conditions are expected in some parts of the country this week. This is the result of a cold front. Eskom has not subject the country to load shedding for almost a month due to some improvement in the performance of the generation fleet. #PowerAlert1 Eskom requests the public to reduce the usage of electricity as the South African Weather
