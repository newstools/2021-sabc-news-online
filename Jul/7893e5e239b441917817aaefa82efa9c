Police in Uganda are on the hunt for a man who posed as a doctor to sell and administer fake coronavirus vaccines to hundreds of people, authorities said on Thursday. The phoney medic persuaded several companies to pay for their employees to receive vaccines. He charged between $28-$56 per shot, according to the head of a public health monitoring unit. Two nurses have been arrested. During a raid on the premises used by the suspects, investigators found vials whose seals had been tampered with and had bogus vaccine labelling and false shipping information. Documents seized showed at least 812 people had been vaccinated but another doctor said the number of victims could be higher. Coronavirus infections and fatalities have soared in Uganda since late May, as the highly infectious Delta variant had fueled the second wave of infections. A vaccination campaign that began in March has been hampered by insufficient deliveries of shots from the vaccine-sharing facility COVAX, which was set up to supply low-income countries. As a result, Ugandans have at times been forced to queue in long lines, sometimes for a whole day, hoping to be vaccinated.
