Suspended ANC member, Carl Niehaus, has been arrested outside the Estcourt Correctional Services Facility in KwaZulu-Natal where former president Jacob Zuma is being held. Niehaus was arrested during a live television interview with SABC News. Initial reports point to allegations of him having violated lockdown regulations. Police take Niehaus away:  Niehaus was among a small group of pro-Zuma supporters who have gathered outside the facility. His arrest comes a day after his ANC membership was suspended for allegedly bringing the party into disrepute. Before his arrest this afternoon, Niehaus described as disappointing – the arrest and incarceration of former president Zuma. Last week, the Constitutional Court found Zuma guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to 15 months in jail for flouting an order to obey summonses and testify at the State Capture Inquiry. He was arrested and jailed last night at the Estcourt Correctional Services Facility in KwaZulu-Natal. Zuma will be eligible for parole after serving three months and three weeks of his sentence. Niehaus says he believes Zuma’s rights have been trampled on. “We are very upset and angry. This is an injustice that has been perpetrated against Zuma. I know there are some people who say that this was a victory for equality before the law, it is not. The manner in which his legitimate constitutional rights have been trampled on has led to a situation where he has now been imprisoned,” he says.
