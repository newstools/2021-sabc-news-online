The Dow and S&P 500 fell on Tuesday, with financials and other groups closely tied to economic growth leading declines, while the Nasdaq edged higher to another closing record. The S&P 500 banks index fell 2.5% as US Treasuries rallied, with the 10-year yield hitting its lowest since February 24. Data showed US services industry activity grew at a moderate pace in June, likely restrained by labor and raw material shortages. The Dow led the day’s declines. Financials sank 1.6%, the biggest weight on the S&P 500 followed by energy shares. Adding to investor caution, a regulatory crackdown by Beijing drove a selloff in shares of several US -listed Chinese firms, including Didi Global Inc. Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm based in Toledo, Ohio, said with Treasury yields down, “investors may be worried the economy might not be a good as the stock market was showing.” Also, investors may be taking profits after a strong end of the quarter and string of recent records. “It was such a good quarter end,” he said. Now, “cyclicals are really getting hit.” The S&P 500 growth index ended up 0.5% after hitting a record high on Tuesday, while the S&P 500 value index fell 1%.

On Tuesday, the Cboe Volatility Index, an options market gauge of expectations for near-term volatility, rose 1.37 points to close at 16.44, its highest close in two weeks, highlighting investors’ jangled nerves. Didi Global shares dropped 19.6% after Chinese regulators ordered over the weekend the company’s app be taken down days after its $4.4 billion listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Other US-listed Chinese e-commerce firms also fell, including Alibaba Group, down 2.8%, and Baidu, down 5%.
