The National Institute for Communicable Diseases says South Africa has recorded 21 610 new coronavirus infections in the past 24-hour cycle, taking the total number of cases to 2 179 297. 265 more people have succumbed to COVID-19 related complications. This puts the national death toll at 65 138. Meanwhile, the Western Cape government is calling for the national government to adopt a different approach in managing COVID-19 across the country. Premier Alan Winde says a differentiated approach would provide a balance between saving lives and livelihoods. “I cannot believe that we have a one size-fit -all for the whole of South Africa where KZN is not even in a third wave technically as yet, and of course Gauteng at the peak of the third wave,  the Western Cape is now climbing. We need to make sure that we are dealing with the balance correctly between regions across our province and across our country,”says Winde   SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 368 975 213 266 91 243 105 521 12 079 2 827 1 535 DEATHS 5 414 14 377 10 871 2 584 1 449 86163 763 653 109 099 61 619 346 202  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 119 719 10 ﻿JULY 2021 2 179 297 64 138 13 848 194 1 9 04 107 21 610 265 Total Vaccination 4 225 021 13 002 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
