The Western Cape Department of Transport has urged taxi drivers and commuters to continue to follow strict COVID-19 safety protocols to curb the spread of the virus. The Department, together with the South African National Taxi Council has visited the Site C taxi rank in Khayelitsha, where they handed out PPE to taxi drivers and conducted COVID-19 inspections. MEC of Transport in the Western Cape, Daylin Mitchell, has called on taxi operators and commuters to work together and continue to wear masks and sanitise their hands to ensure safety in the industry. “It’s the duty of the taxi driver to ensure that the passengers are safe, but also that the passengers keep each other safe, so the intention is also to inform them about ensuring that there’s enough ventilation, but ultimately, to ensure that together, we flatten the curve in the Western Cape” says Mitchell. He makes the call in the audio clip below: On Tuesday, 10% of the new COVID-19 cases reported were from the Western Cape. The province has so far reported 335 116 infections since the outbreak of the pandemic in South Africa, which is 16% of the country’s total number of cases.
