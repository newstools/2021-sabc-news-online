The Western Cape Health Department says more than 744 000 COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across the province. Premier Alan Winde says they have partnered with authorities on a registration drive and pop-up vaccination site at a local shopping centre in Khayelitsha. He says the drive aims to identify communities with low registration rates and create opportunities to register and vaccinate vulnerable community members closer to their homes. The number of active COVID-19 cases in the province is just over 31 000. There are currently 2 841 people being treated in hospital with 616 people in ICU. The outbreak of violence and looting in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng will further delay the countryâ€™s vaccination rollout programme, according to the Independent Community Pharmacy Association (ICPA). The Association says independent pharmacies are among the shops looted and medication worth millions of rands have been stolen or destroyed. Full statement below:
