Britain recorded 24 885 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, down from 27 125 a day earlier, and 18 deaths, also lower than the 27 reported on Friday, official data showed. Daily positive cases have been rising in Britain for a month but a rapid vaccination programme appears to have weakened the link between infections and deaths. The data also showed that 45.1 million people have had a first dose of a vaccine and 33.4 million have had two. Meanwhile the United States has administered 330 604 253 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Sunday morning and distributed 383 068 740 doses, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
