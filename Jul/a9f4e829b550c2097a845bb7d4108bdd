The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members are supporting the African Unionâ€™s (AU) mediation efforts on the Nile dam row between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. On Thursday, UNSC members asked the three countries to resume negotiations, which have yielded little progress since they began a decade ago. US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, says the negotiations should be held under the leadership of the AU and should recommence with urgency. Russia proposed that the three parties should meet while in New York to try to resolve the issues. Egypt and Sudan had called on the UNSC to help resolve the row after Ethiopia informed them that the second-stage filling of the dam had begun. The two countries want the council to push for a binding agreement over the filling and operation of the dam. Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan launch new AU-chaired Nile Dam talks:
