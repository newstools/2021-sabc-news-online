The funeral service of the late mayor of the City of Johannesburg, Geoff Makhubo, will take place on Wednesday. The ANC in the Greater Johannesburg region says a time for the virtual service will be announced later. Makhubo died on Friday morning following COVID-19  complications. The funeral service will be preceded by a virtual prayer session on Sunday and ANC virtual memorial services on Monday and Tuesday. Makhubo lauded  as an experienced public servant:  President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the passing of Makhubo, as a loss to the city and the province at large. Ramaphosa extended his condolences to the family, friends, colleagues and comrades of the late mayor. “The passing of Mayor Makhubo is a stark reminder of the threat posed by this deadly pandemic against which we are all extremely vulnerable,” says Ramaphosa. The president lauded Makhubo for his contribution to the national effort to fight the pandemic. “Since he received his own diagnosis in June this year, Mayor Makhubo regularly posted public health messages urging people to take responsibility for their own safety and that of others,” Ramaphosa added. Ramaphosa says Makhubo was an experienced public servant in the City of Johannesburg, including as a Member of the Mayoral Committee for Finance (MMC), as leader of the opposition in council, and then as mayor. “Losing Makhubo at such a difficult time for the City of Johannesburg and the country is a blow; our thoughts and prayers are with the family and with his colleagues at this difficult time.”
