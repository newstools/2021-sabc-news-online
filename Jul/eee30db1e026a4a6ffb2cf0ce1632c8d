Parents facing shortages of baby formula are being urged to use the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) guidelines for baby milk. The destruction of stores and the closure of those that remain has left critical baby products in short supply. Specialist physician, Dr Chantelle van der Bijl, says the suggestions by the world body is only a short-term solution for emergency situations. “If you have a friend that has got some breast milk stored in their freezer maybe to contact them and try and get some milk from them. Otherwise, the WHO does have some guidelines where you can use either full cream cow’s milk, you can use powdered milk, also evaporated milk. For children above six months, you can use full cream cow’s milk without adding any sugar or water as mentioned in the recipes. These are very particularly in grams and mls and you have to follow these recipes exactly because they were worked out to provide your baby with enough proteins and carbs. This is just a short term solution. This is not to be use for a long term,” explains Van der Bijl.
