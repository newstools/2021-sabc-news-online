Zambia’s founding President, Kenneth Kaunda, has been laid to rest at the country’s presidential burial site. This after the High Court dismissed a challenge by one of his sons that this would be against his wishes. Kaunda died on June 17 in a military hospital in Lusaka. Kaunda’s son Kaweche had challenged in court the government’s plan to bury his father’s remains at Embassy Park, where other former heads of state are buried. Kaweche Kaunda said his father’s last wish was to be buried at his residence next to his wife, Betty, who died more than 10 years ago. In a ruling delivered while the burial was underway, High Court Judge Wilfred Muma said there was no clear arguable case made by the applicant for judicial review.
