This after an outbreak and spread of Foot and Mouth disease which was first discovered in May at the Umkhanyakude District Municipality. The virus strain has been identified as a FMD SAT2. However, economists have raised concerns over the biosecurity challenges in the Livestock and Poultry sectors. The Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural development, Thoko Didiza says the origins of the outbreak are still under investigation. “The district municipalities of King Cetshwayo, Umkhanyakude and Zululand in KwaZulu-Natal a disease management area, this is done in order to contain the spread of the disease in the areas. What this means  is that farmers are not allowed to move to areas outside of these districts and farmers will have to get a permit from the vets services in that area.”
