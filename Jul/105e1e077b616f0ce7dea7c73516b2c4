Zikalala says mining operations will resume on Monday next week. “The agreement reached between the engagements that ensued today will help us ensure that RBM is able to resume its operations no later than Monday. The Department of Community Safety and Liaison, SAPS and the municipality to monitor the area and ensure that the situation returns to normality and prevent bloodshed,” says Zikalala. “As part of growing the economy and creating jobs, there has been serious instability here which has been expressed by protest, burning of property, construction, then killings. All of that has been elevated. We’ve taken all of those cases and elevated that to a provincial team and a multi-disciplinary team composed of investigators, intelligence and all of those involved are dealing with those cases,” he says.
