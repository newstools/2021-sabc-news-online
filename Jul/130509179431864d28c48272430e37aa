The United States has administered 333 565 404 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Saturday morning and distributed 386 985 420 doses, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on its website. The figures were up from the 332 966 409 doses the CDC said had been administered by Friday out of 386 058 070 doses delivered. The Atlanta-based agency said 183 836 917 people had received at least one dose while 158 954 417 people were fully vaccinated as of Saturday. The CDC tally counted two-dose vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer /BioNTech , as well as Johnston & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine as of 6am on Saturday. US COVID-19 cases are up around 11% over the previous week, almost entirely among people who have not been vaccinated, officials said on Thursday, as the highly infectious Delta variant becomes the dominant COVID-19 strain in the country. Pfizer and partner BioNtech plan to ask US and European regulators within weeks to authorize a booster dose of its COVID-19 vaccine, based on evidence of greater risk of infection six months after inoculation and the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, however, in a joint statement that Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster COVID-19 shot at this time.
