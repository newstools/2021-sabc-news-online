The High Court in Cape Town has struck the urgent application against parliament off the roll. Letlhogonolo Maimane wanted to stop parliament from further continuing with the process of appointing a new seven-member board for the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA). In his court papers, Maimane cited National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise as the first respondent, the co-chairpersons of the sub-committee of the Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities as the second respondent. However, Parliament spokesperson, Moloto Mothapo, says the NCOP Chairperson was supposed to be cited as the second respondent as the process of interviewing the NYDA candidates is undertaken by both the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) and the National Assembly. Mothapo says Maimane was one of more than 1 000 applicants who wanted a spot in the new NYDA board. Young people discuss unemployment:  The NYDA has been without a board for more than a year now and the successfully shortlisted candidates will know their fate after all other processes have been followed. The next process will be for the Sub-Committee to deliberate on the names of the interviewed candidates and choose the best ones, before submitting their names to the Joint Portfolio Committee. The names of the recommended candidates will have to be adopted by the committee, which will then seek the final approval of the National Assembly and the NCOP for the new NYDA Board. It will only be after all these parliamentary processes that the new board will be appointed by the Minister in the Presidency for Women Youth and Persons with Disabilities.
