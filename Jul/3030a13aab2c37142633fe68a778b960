Mining company, Richards Bay Minerals (RBM), has temporarily suspended its operations due to the ongoing crime and violence against the mine. This after several heavy duty graders and cranes were set alight by unknown suspects. In April the mine’s general manager for operational services, Nico Swart, was shot and killed on his way to work. RBM’s Managing Director – Werner Duvenhage – says because of the recent deterioration in the security situation, parent company Rio Tinto has decided to halt its operations. “While we work hard to make a lasting positive contribution to the areas in which we operate. The safety of our employees’ contractors and communities remain our utmost priority and therefore we have taken the difficulty decision to seize all activities at our operations. It is vital that those responsible for the recent acts of criminality are identified and brought to book and to that end we hope to continue working with all our stakeholders to solve our common problems,” says Duvenhage. RBM contributes close to R8 billion to the country’s economy. Its closure will affect 5 000 employees. – Report by Nonhlakanipho Magwaza
