Argentina on Thursday announced it will sign a COVID-19 vaccine supply agreement with Moderna, as the country attempts to speed up the inoculation of its population and sidestep a possible third wave of the coronavirus. Cabinet chief Santiago Cafiero told Argentina’s Congress that a deal would be signed with US-based Moderna on Monday, but did not detail the number of doses being bought or the agreed delivery dates. Argentina has so far largely built its COVID-19 inoculation programme around Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, China’s Sinopharm vaccine and British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca’s vaccine. It has vaccinated 23.7 million of its 45 million inhabitants with at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 4.9 million people have received two. As of Wednesday, Argentina had registered 4.6 million cases of COVID-19 and 97 000 related deaths. The country is at present seeing a decline in cases after a precipitous second wave that triggered fresh lockdowns.
