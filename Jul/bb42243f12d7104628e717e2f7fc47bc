City Power unable to provide services City Power says the violent protests in Johannesburg have led to a number of their technical teams not being able to provide services this morning. The entity says some teams were withdrawn, due to safety concerns. City Power spokesperson Isaac Mangena says, “City Power has noticed protest riots in certain areas around Johannesburg which makes it difficult for us to provide services. As an entity, priority is always given to the safety of our employees and contractors, and the equipment. As such a risk assessment was made this morning and a decision was made to withdraw our teams in areas hardest hit by riots, to protect the lives of our teams, including contractors, and the property.”
