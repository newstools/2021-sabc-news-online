The Delta variant of the coronavirus is said to be driving the third wave of COVID-19 infections across the country since May 2021. The Delta variant, first identified in India, has affected KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and the Western Cape, with the highest infection rates in Gauteng which is leading the number of cases and with tighter restrictions. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) confirmed that the Delta variant has become more dominant in South Africa, however the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa, still leads infections in the country. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned South Africa to be vigilant since the variant is said to spread easier and is able to evade immunity.
