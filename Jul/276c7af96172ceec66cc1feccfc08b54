The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Community (NEC) has instructed the office of the secretary-general and the KwaZulu-Natal provincial secretary to immediately institute disciplinary action against organisers of the activities that took place outside former president Jacob Zuma’s home in Nkandla at the weekend. This is part of the outcomes of a special NEC meeting held on Monday. The meeting reflected on the developments in Nkandla arising from the sentencing of Zuma. Hundreds of supporters gathered outside Zuma’s home in contradiction of lockdown regulations. ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte addressed the media in Johannesburg. ANC briefs media on outcomes of the NEC meeting:  Police say they are investigating several cases following the violation of lockdown regulations at former president Jacob Zuma’s home in Nkandla, north of KwaZulu-Natal. Scores of Zuma’s supporters gathered outside his home to offer him support following an urgent court application for a stay of execution of his arrest pending another application in the Constitutional Court. Some shots were also fired during the gathering. National police spokesperson Vish Naidoo says, “When we spoke about what was happening in Nkandla, we didn’t only speak about the contravention of the disaster management regulations. We spoke holistically about undermining the authority of the state, and that’s inclusive of people allegedly firing shots at that gathering. So there are various issues that we are looking at … we don’t anticipate or pre-empt when arrests are taking place.”
