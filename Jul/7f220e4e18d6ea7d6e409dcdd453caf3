President Cyril Ramaphosa is currently studying the final report by the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) into the investigation of a R150 million contract between the National Department of Health (NDH) and service provider, Digital Vibes, the Presidency has said. The Presidency acknowledged the receipt of the final report on Tuesday. Digital Vibes is said to be linked to Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, and was given the R150 million contract to provide communication on COVID-19 related information to the public. Mkhize was placed on special leave following the allegations. Acting spokesperson for the president, Tyrone Seale, has acknowledged the president’s receipt of the report into the scandal. “The Presidency is studying the report and will keep the public abreast of developments in this matter. It will do so in a manner that preserves information that may be or become the subject of prosecution, civil action or disciplinary proceedings,” adds Seale. The office of the president has, however, not given much information on what is contained in the report by the SIU’s final report. SIU freezes bank accounts of individuals linked to Digital Vibes:  The SIU was granted the preservation order last week to freeze about R22 million held in bank and investment accounts linked to entities or individuals that received payments from Digital Vibes.
