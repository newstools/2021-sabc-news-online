KwaZulu-Natal police arrested 239 suspects in connection with gender-based violence (GBV) crimes in the month of June. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbele says the charges include statutory rape, kidnapping, abduction and rape among other serious alleged offences. Mbele says the arrests show the success of the KwaZulu Natal Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units. “The KwaZulu Natal Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units are continuing to make the province a safer and better place for women and children by putting perpetrators of GBV in jail,” says Mbele. She says, “From 1 June to 30 June 2021, detectives from KwaZulu-Natal FCS Units arrested 239 suspects for crimes such as statutory rape, kidnapping, abduction, rape, attempted murder, assault with the intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, child neglect and indecent exposure.” Suspects have appeared in various courts within the province.
