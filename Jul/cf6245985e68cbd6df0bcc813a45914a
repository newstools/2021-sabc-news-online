The Constitutional Court has agreed to hear former president Jacob Zuma’s application to have his 15-month jail sentence rescinded. Zuma was sentenced for contempt by the Apex Court after he ignored directives that he continue testifying at the State Capture Commission. The Concourt will hear his application on Monday, the 12th of July. According to court papers in possession of SABC News, opposing parties on the matter have until July 6 to file their cases. Zuma emerged on Saturday afternoon outside his home for the first since the damning Constitutional Court ruling against him. He was flanked by the Amabutho (Zulu regiments) and some of his supporters. #sabcnews #sabckzn Zuma with Amabutho leader Mgiliji Nhleko in Nkandla. pic.twitter.com/bYyRA65oLT — Nonkululeko Hlophe (@Leko3) July 3, 2021  Hundreds of Zuma’s supporters remain stationed outside his home in Nkandla, in northern KwaZulu-Natal, and there are concerns about this becoming a coronavirus super spreader event. Suspended ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, is one of the ANC leaders who are in Nkandla to meet with Zuma. He has pledged his support to the former president. Magashule arrives in Nkandla:  Zuma was expected to address the crowds on Sunday but it is not yet clear whether this still stands following the Constitutional Court’s decision to grant his request to plead his case. #Amabutho showing their support for former President #JacobZuma. #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/chpGQY0XTv — #TheLordOfTheMedia (@samkelemaseko) July 3, 2021  ANC leaders discussing the Zuma quagmire:  #sabcnews #sabckzn Scenes outside the former president Jacob Zuma’s home in Nkandla, some ANC members singing. pic.twitter.com/6ELTmX1SkF — Nonkululeko Hlophe (@Leko3) July 3, 2021
