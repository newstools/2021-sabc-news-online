As the steady rise in COVID-19 cases in the Eastern Cape continues, the Buffalo City Metro Municipality is urging residents to take extra precautionary measures in preventing the spread of the virus. The Metro is one of the province’s worst-hit regions. East London has been declared a hotspot with infections flaring up daily in many of the city’s suburbs. Speaking after receiving his second vaccination of the Pfizer vaccine at the Bhisho Hospital, Mayor Xola Pakati warned that those who flout regulations will be brought to book. “We call upon our communities to remain vigilant. We will ensure that the regulations that were gazetted by the Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma are observed. To that end, we will deploy the law enforcement agencies to ensure compliance. I call upon our people to be very vigilant. Sanitise your hands, keep the social distancing and wear your masks,” explains Pakati. National Coronavirus Command Council briefs media on COVID-19 Level 4 regulations:  Phakathi also says with the threat of a third wave of the COVID-19 and the new Delta variant – both Pfizer vaccine doses are important. He encourages eligible individuals to get the vaccination. “We would like to remind all those who are eligible for vaccination that they should do so. Our public institutions are open for all those who are healthy and eligible for vaccination, and I really beg our people to go and vaccinate,” he adds. Overnight, South Africa recorded almost 20 000 new COVID-19 cases and 383 fatalities.
