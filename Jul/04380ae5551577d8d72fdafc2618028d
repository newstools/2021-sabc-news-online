President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africans will not allow for anarchy to continue, saying people who instigate instability will not prevail. Unrest in the country began last weekend when protesters took to the streets demanding the release of former president Jacob Zuma after his incarceration. The demonstrations then morphed into mass looting and vandalism, mostly in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Multiple arrests in Katlehong as looting continues:  The situation has stabilised in most parts of the country. Speaking to the media in KwaMashu, Durban, Ramaphosa commended the public for their efforts to protect and clean-up the areas they reside in. “The instigators want to spread instability in the country and we don’t know what their full and true intentions are but the democratic state is what our people are defending as well as their assets. So yes, we could have acted quicker but they have now joined hands with us which demonstrates that the intentions of the instigators is failing because it is our people who are now coming to the defence of all our people,” says Ramaphosa. The presiddnt says so far in KwaZulu-Natal, 95 people have lost their lives in the ongoing unrest. He also confirmed that over 25 000 SANDF troops will be deployed in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal to protect the structures that are still standing and the safety of residents. “It’s quite clear that this all these incidents of unrest and looting were instigated, they were people who planned it and it was coordinated we are going after them. we have identified a good number of them and we will not allow anarchy and mayhem to just unfold on our country. There’s so much damage that has been done to the country and people have lost their lives that is the most concerning issue and here in kzn alone 95 people have already lost their lives” says President Ramaphosa.
