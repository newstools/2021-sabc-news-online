The head of the Hawks, Godfrey Lebeya, has given parliament an overview of corruption-related investigations being conducted by the unit. Various law enforcement agencies appeared before Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) to discuss corruption matters under investigation. Lebeya says they have received 131 cases from the Special Investigating Unit (SIU). “These are matters from 2010 amount estimated R3.4 billion. Majority of cases involved fraud, corruption, contravention of  the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) and money laundering,” he says. SCOPA berates entities for unnecessary procurement deviations:  Last week, Scopa warned public entities against abusing the “deviations and expansions” policy to escape thorough procurement processes in the public sector. Scopa says the deviations policy must only be used as the last resort and applied in exceptional circumstances when all other relevant options have been tried.
