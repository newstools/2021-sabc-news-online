The Western Cape Minister of Transport and Public Works, Daylin Mitchell will meet with taxi associations Capital Area Transportation Authority (Cata ) and Congress of Democratic Taxi Associations (Codeta) on Thursday. Taxi violence in Cape Town reached peak highs leaving at least 11 people dead and commuters wounded in escalating taxi wars in the Cape Metro over the past few days. Mitchell says despite a number of meetings, the matter has been escalated with the possible closure of certain taxi routes. Mitchell says while he remains committed to finding a lasting resolution to the dispute between the rivals, the violence cannot be allowed to continue unabated. Western Cape transport authorities consider closing taxi ranks  South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) has called a special executive meeting, with spokesperson Gershon Geyer saying he is unsure what triggered Tuesday morning’s shootings. “There was supposed to be a meeting today, it was postponed between Cata and Codeta. So we don’t know what triggered the shooting and violence, we have no idea what happened,” said Geyer. Police say arrests for all the shootings are yet to be made. But they say there were arrests for possession of illegal firearms that have been sent for ballistic testing to see if they were used in the recent taxi killings.
