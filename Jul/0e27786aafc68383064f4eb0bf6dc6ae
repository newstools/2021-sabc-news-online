South Africa is set to start rolling out Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine after it received conditional approval from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA). The Chinese-made vaccine is being used in many countries and it has been shown to be effective in preventing severe disease and death. However, there are some questions about its general efficacy. SAHPRA’s CEO, Dr. Boitumelo Semete-Makokotlela says: “With regards to the Sinovac vaccine we are still receiving data all the time from the manufacturers and we will keep the public updated as to when and where the vaccine will be administered. We are still in the process of sorting some things out. We also need to make sure that this vaccine is safe and has gone through the necessary testing phase.”
