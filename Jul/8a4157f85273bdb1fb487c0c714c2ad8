The president of Mozambique, Filipe Nyusi, has confirmed the arrival of troops from Rwanda to support the fight against terrorist attacks in Cabo Delgado. The province has been battling insurgency since October 2017. This latest development has not been received well, especially because the Southern African Development Community (SADC) was meant to have been first to deploy its joint forces. However, Mozambique’s Minister of Defence, Jaime Neto, denies this move is meant to undercut SADC’s intervention efforts. “At the ministerial level, we may not always have concrete information on what has been dealt with but Cabo Delgado is a privileged subjects for Heads of State at the level of SADC region and obviously at our level it’s up to us to take decisions from consultations that occurred out at the level of the Heads of State,” says Neto.

Minister of Defence and Military Veterans Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula confirmed that the country’s army will be among SADC security forces that will be giving support to the Mozambican people. “SADC summit met and the decision has been taken which has given a mandate to our armed forces to moving to Mozambique and give support to the Mozambican people. So whatever it is whether Mozambique would have had a problem with South Africa which I’m not aware of. Yes I am aware of some of the people who have been arrested in Mozambique and how how that matter has turned out,” she said. Mapisa-Nqakula on situation in Mozambique:
