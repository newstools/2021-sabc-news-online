African National Congress (ANC) spokesperson, Pule Mabe, has welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s announcement that those who lit the flames of looting and violence in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal must be found and prosecuted. President Ramaphosa addressed the nation on the latest developments following the unrest.  He’s authorised the deployment of 25 000 soldiers to help police restore law and order. Ten thousand of those troops have already been deployed and the remainder will take up their positions this weekend. Mabe says the criminal elements that sought to collapse the state must face the full might of the law. The ANC spokesperson has urged ordinary people to come out and help clean up their local areas after the mass looting and violence. He says the country has a storied history of local communities taking responsibility for their local areas.
