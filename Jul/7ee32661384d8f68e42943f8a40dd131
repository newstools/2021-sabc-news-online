The entire N3 Toll Route from Cedara to Heidelberg has been closed. In a statement, the N3 Toll Concession says that the entire route from Cedara in KwaZulu-Natal to Heidelberg south in Gauteng will remain closed until further notice. New reports were received on Monday night of a violent mob looting the Engen Tugela One Stop North, and of protestors burning tyres along this section of the route. The security of Tugela Plaza in KwaZulu-Natal and De Hoek Plaza is also under renewed threat. Personnel have been evacuated from all toll plazas on the route. Rob Bryne gives you the latest traffic news in the video below:  The violent protests erupted after the incarceration of former president Jacob Zuma last week. His supporters want him released from prison, where he is serving a 15-month sentence for defying a Constitutional Court order.
