The Gauteng Department of Education is concerned that over 9000 educators are refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The department says while vaccination is voluntary, the World Health Organization (WHO) encourages people at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 such as healthcare providers, educators, older or elderly adults, to take the shot to reduce the risk of developing the illness and its consequences. Gauteng Education Spokesperson Steve Mabona says they are extremely alarmed that some educators and supporting staff are refusing to take the jab, despite being on the priority list. “Last week, the education sector announced the start of the massive Education Sector Vaccination Rollout Programme which aimed to vaccinate those who work in this important sector.  So far, 53 154 educators and support staff have been vaccinated. And the overall figure that we are targeting is 125 000. As a sector, we prioritised to finalise this process and we cannot delay. We call upon those that are refusing to vaccinate, to take this opportunity and make sure that they vaccinate.” [MEDIA STATEMENT]: The Gauteng Department of Education is extremely alarmed that 9 113 educators and support staff – some with comorbidities are refusing to take the life-saving COVID-19 vaccination jabs. @Lesufi @Steve_Mabona @GautengProvince @GautengHealth #VaccinesSaveLives pic.twitter.com/EzOU1S5p6z — Gauteng Department of Education (@EducationGP1) July 2, 2021  VIDEO: Gauteng educators receive their COVID-19 vaccines: President for South African Teachers’ Union, Dr. Chris Klopper says members are happy with the vaccine drive in the education sector: Klopper is interviewed by SABC News:
