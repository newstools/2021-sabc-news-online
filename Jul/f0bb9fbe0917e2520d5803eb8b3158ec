Kubayi-Ngubane was addressing the nation on the current state of the pandemic in the country. She says Gauteng remains the epicentre, accounting for 60% of all new infections. “We are sitting at 21 584 new cases. And also which is higher than the average number of new cases per day. The positivity testing rate has also increased from 27- 28.4% in the last 24 hours. It shows an increasing number in many provinces across the country, but Gauteng continues to be the epicentre of new infections, with the number of new cases haven risen to 12 806 last night,” she says. Acting Health Minister leads media briefing on COVID-19:  Kubayi-Ngubane has reiterated the warning that people who were previously infected with the COVID-19 Alpha and Beta variants risk being re-infected should they contract the Delta variant. “There is now good evidence that the Delta variant is more transmissible than previously circulating viruses and other variants of concern. It is important to remind the public that the Beta variant is still prevalent. Those who were previously infected by the Beta were immune from reinfection from the Alpha and Beta variants. But it is not the case with the Delta variant. This means that those who had COVID-19 are also at risk of reinfection by the Delta variant.” Latest SA stats: SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 355 847 207 610 77 457 95 752 11 902 2 648 1 525 DEATHS 5 041 13 094 10 708 2 286 1 392 86163 662 300 97 154 59 330 324 891  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 115 215 1 JULY 2021 1 995 556 61 029 13 133 428 1 754 793 21 584 382 Total Vaccination 3 155 717 12 433 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
