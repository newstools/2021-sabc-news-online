The Democratic Alliance has welcomed Parliament’s Police Committee’s decision to convene an urgent meeting to discuss the widespread violence and looting in some areas of KwaZulu-Natal(KZN) and Gauteng. The meeting is scheduled to take place this morning. DA MP on Police, Andrew Whitfield says this will give the committee a chance to get to the bottom of the failures of policing and intelligence. “The DA believes this has been a complete failure of crime intelligence and pre-emptive policing to what was an obvious outcome of jailing former President Jacob Zuma.” Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to conduct an oversight visit to KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) on Friday. This is after the violent civil unrest and looting in the province this past week.
