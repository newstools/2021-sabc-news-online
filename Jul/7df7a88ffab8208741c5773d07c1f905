The government has offered civil servants a 1.5% salary increase plus a cash payment in wage negotiations with trade unions, Public Service and Administration Minister Senzo Mchunu said on Monday. Unions previously said the negotiations had reached a deadlock after the government initially offered no increase. The government is trying to contain its wage bill, which accounts for around a third of consolidated spending, to rein in a steep rise in debt that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. “The offer is 1.5% which is pensionable and is on the baseline,” Mchunu told a news conference. “Secondly, there is a cash gratuity which ranges from R1,220 R1,695.” The unions had yet to respond to the offer. Mchunu said the government and unions would meet to discuss it on Tuesday.
