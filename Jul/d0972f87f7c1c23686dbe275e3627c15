A total of three people have been taken into custody for allegedly instigating the violence that hit KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng recently. They are expected to appear in court within the next few days. The three are not part of the 12 people mentioned last week who are suspected to be the masterminds of the violence and looting. The unrest and looting in KZN and Gauteng followed protests outside the Estcourt prison where former president Jacob Zuma was incarcerated last weekend. In a statement, the police referred to the violence as a failed insurrection. At least 212 people have died and over 2 000 others have been arrested. Following a meeting with community members in Durban on Sunday, Police Minister Bheki Cele told SABC News: “Do we have any movement on that, the latest on how many people have been arrested because people are waiting for answers? We do. The names of 3 people have, but there are other names that have been given to the security forces. Unfortunately, we are not going to be able to name those people until they are arrested and come to court. But it seems as soon as tomorrow those names will come to the public eye.” Cele also says the police in KwaZulu-Natal have put together a team to trace goods that were stolen in looting and arrest people. “That will help to understand that you can’t just move around, steal everything and go…(expect) life to be normal. And it will also tell the aspirant looters to say even when you have looted, we will still come and find the stuff.” The video below is of Cele briefing the media in Phoenix after engaging the community on Saturday:
