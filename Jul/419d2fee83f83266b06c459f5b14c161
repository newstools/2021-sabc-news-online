Gauteng police say they are out in full force in the province enforcing COVID-19 regulations. The province has become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. Gauteng Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Tommy Mthombeni, has urged people not to travel in and out of the province unnecessarily. “In terms of regulation 21, there have to be no gatherings but over and above it is a fact that in Gauteng we are having 10 roadblocks inbound which is supplemented by the other province. The other roads which are provincial routes we have from time to time, we deal with those vehicle checkpoints in those specific areas.” COVID-19 in South Africa: Meanwhile,  South Africa recorded 21 610 new COVID-19 infections in the past 24 hours, taking the total cases to 2 179 297.
