Rwanda has begun deploying a thousand security officers to Mozambique. The contingent consists of members of the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) and Rwanda National Police (RNP). The officers will be deployed to Cabo Delgado Province, which is currently affected by terrorism and insecurity, a statement from the government indicated. The statement issued on Friday indicated that the deployment followed a request from the Mozambique government to Rwanda. Images on various Rwandan social media sites showed uniformed security officers boarding a Rwanda Air flight. It further indicated that the security forces will work closely with the Mozambican Armed Defence Forces as well as forces from the Southern African Development Community (SADC). SADC has indicated that beginning Thursday next week, member countries of the regional economic bloc will begin deploying troops to Mozambique to help combat the insurgent for a period of three months. Thousands of people have been killed and thousands more have been displaced since 2017 in attacks linked to an insurgent group operating in the north of Mozambique. Mozambiqueâ€™s Cabo Delgado province could become the next target for militant insurgency:  Last month, SADC agreed to send troops to combat to the GAR rich region.
