The N3 Toll Route into KwaZulu-Natal is now open. The N3 Toll Concession says law enforcement authorities have announced the full re-opening of the highway between Cedara in KwaZulu-Natal and Heidelberg in Gauteng. Operations manager Thania Dhoogra is cautioning road users to expect high traffic volumes, congestion and possible delays. Law enforcement agencies are deployed on the N3 toll route and will be maintaining a highly visible presence. Trucks travel on the N3 highway between KZN and Gauteng delivering goods A handful of trucks are making their way through the N3 highway on Friday morning – delivering supplies from KwaZulu Natal to Gauteng. This follows widespread looting and vandalism across both provinces over the past few days – with clean-up operations now underway. The N3 has been closed and it’s unclear whether it is open. All the boom gates were still red but cars coming from the Gauteng were not yet visible. Truck drivers seemed happy that they were able to move in and out of the area. It’s been a week since the N3 Highway that connects Durban and Johannesburg closed down. This is due to the ongoing violence and looting in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. The closure of the trade route has seen a cut in food supply and other essential goods. KZN Unrest |  Assessing the extent of damage along the Mooi River Toll Plaza  Kwazulu Natal is the second highest contributor to the country’s gross domestic products. The Mooi River toll gate leading to Pietermaritzburg remains closed. This is where the first looting incident took place a week ago. It is also where over 20 trucks were set to light in just one night. Ashes are all that’s left of the fiery scenes last week. Law enforcement agencies remain on the route with some cars and trucks continue to pass through the route at their own risk.
