Three people have died and 26 injured when a fire ravaged the informal settlement, Plastic View, east of Pretoria on Saturday night. The informal settlement is home to a mixture of South Africans and immigrants who live in close quarters to each other. Eighty-nine shacks were also destroyed. Last year on Mandela Day hundreds of residents were left homeless when a fire also gutted the informal settlement. Donations for food, clothing, blankets, cooking utensils and toiletries can be dropped off at the adjacent Moreletta Park NG Church. The City of Tshwane’s Jordan Griffiths says the Emergency Services of the City of Tshwane were able to quickly extinguish the fire. “Unfortunately, 89 structures were destroyed and to date, 3 fatalities have been confirmed. And it is estimated that 26 people have been injured and are currently in hospital. On the ground currently is MMC Dana Wannenberg from waste management to assist in clearing the site along with MMC Thabisile Vilakazi from Social Development, to assist where the city can support.” “We’ve also engaged with volunteers at the local church and respective NGO’s. Along with MMC Mpho Mehlape-Zimu from Human Settlements who is also assessing what further support can be provided to the community.”
