The ministry of health in Botswana says there has been a delay in the arrival of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the country. The vaccine was expected to be used as the second dose of the vaccination rollout. The ministry expected the doses to be available by the end of June. “The ministry was expecting the AstraZeneca vaccine consignment procured through the COVAX facility by the last week of June 2021. The ministry has been informed that the expected delivery is now likely to take place in August,” says departmental spokesperson, Christopher Nyanga. Nyanga says those who are awaiting their second dose will get other COVID-19 vaccines. “Some vaccination centres across the country have started experiencing shortages. The shortfall in the AstraZeneca vaccine is about 15 000 doses, resulting in people of the same number likely to get their second doses beyond the initially anticipated 12 weeks. A decision was taken that all those affected by these developments be offered Moderna or Pfizer vaccines as second doses,” he says. Botswana has 86 133 COVID-19 cases and 1 274 so far.
