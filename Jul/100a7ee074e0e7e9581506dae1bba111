The head of the Investigative Directorate, which falls under the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), says COVID-19 is complicating their investigations even more. Hermione Cronje says some of the suspects are dying due to the virus. Cronje says a suspect involved in the awarding of a major Kusile contract has passed away. “One of the suspects we wanted to arrest and bring to court passed away a week ago of COVID-19. Two weeks prior to that, our investigators, two of them were in hospital due to COVID-19,” says Cronje. The head of the Hawks, Godfrey Lebeya, says his already thinly-stretched unit is being crippled by the COVID-19 virus. Various law enforcement agencies appeared before Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts to brief Members of Parliament on the progress of investigations into their corruption-related cases. The Hawks also have a more than 50% vacancy rate. Lebeya says the COVID-19 pandemic makes matters worse. “The reason why deputy-head is not here, she is recovering from COVID-19  and also preparing the funeral of her husband for Sunday, based on COVID-19 related death. Due to COVID-19, we have lost ten of our members.” Latest COVID-19 stats in SA South Africa has recorded 15 501 new COVID-19 cases, taking the accumulative infections to 2 090 909.
