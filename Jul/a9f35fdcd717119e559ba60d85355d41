It is relatively quiet in the Kingdom of Eswatini. Pro-democracy groupings have rendered the landlocked kingdom ungovernable demanding political reform among others. People took to the streets, burning tyres, vandalising property and looting shops. Trucks were looted and some damaged. Police and military forces responded by firing teargas to quell the civil unrest. Unconfirmed reports suggest that more than 60 people have been killed and over two hundred injured. The government has since announced a nationwide curfew from 6am to 5am. Several network providers have allegedly shut down internet connections. The People’s United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO) President, Mlungisi Makhanya, says they have resolved to embark on stay-away from Saturday. “It would be irresponsible for us to continue urging our people to go out there to put their lives at risk. We decided what we are going to do, we are going to embark on a mass stay away. We are going to urge our people to turn out on Saturday next week when we are going to have a series of prayers for all the departed souls who have been killed in this noble struggle” Makhanya further says that King Mswati the third should be held liable for the alleged brutal killing of protesters. “We have visited a number of police stations trying to enquire about the whereabouts of many of these kids who are being kidnapped in the middle of the night by the soldiers of this regime. The main hospital Mbabane had amputated 16 people, with the last patient having had both legs amputated but also I’ve seen dead bodies who have been shot. We hold King Mswati solely liable for this massacre of our people.” Below is Makhanya’s full interview:
