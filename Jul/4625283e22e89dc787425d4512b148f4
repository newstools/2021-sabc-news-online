Shopping malls have become targets. With huge implications for those trying to put bread on the table. Shoprite, Pick n Pay, Woolworths and Makro have all confirmed that their stores have been affected by the unrest in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Tiger Brands who owns KOO, Albany Bread and Tastic Rice said the incidents of looting and vandalism have had a material impact on operations and it has lost stock in excess of R150 million. Pick n Pay says it wants to reassure customers in KwaZulu-Natal that teams are now working flat out to bring essential supplies from Gauteng and the Western Cape. It says the reopening of the N3 highway between Gauteng and KZN helps and the relief is coming.  Meanwhile, Acting Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni says major economic corridors have been reopened after the looting and violence. The N3 and N2 highways in KwaZulu-Natal are now open. She says this will help allay people’s fears about any shortages of fuel and food. Ntshaveni says the focus is now on rebuilding after the devastating looting that hit Gauteng and KZN: “Government has also engaged key role players in economic cluster to find ways of rebuilding economy. The factories that have been damaged. Reopen businesses and minimise the loss of jobs. We are working on immediate plan for insuring economic recovery and restoring the confidence of our people, our industries and our investors.”
