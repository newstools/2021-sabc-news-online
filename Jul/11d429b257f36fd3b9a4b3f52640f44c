The situation remains tense at Nkandla in northern KwaZulu-Natal as the deadline for the arrest of former President Jacob Zuma looms. The Police Ministry says if it doesn’t receive a response from the office of the Acting-Chief Justice by the end of business on Wednesday, they will have no choice but to effect the arrest warrant against the former President.  An SABC News reporter witnessed three police vehicles being turned away from the former President’s home earlier on Wednesday. It is not clear why the vehicles were turned away. “A short while ago we saw three police vehicles trying to enter the main gate of former President Jacob Zuma’s home but a gentleman wearing the MKMVA (Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association) regalia approached them and they turned back and drove off. So we don’t know what they were here for but they, unfortunately, could not gain access to the home,” notes the reporter.
