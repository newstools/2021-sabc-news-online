Another major storm is expected to make landfall in the Western Cape on Monday bringing with it heavy rain, about 15 centimetres of snow on mountain peaks and very cold temperatures. The South African Weather Service says they expect up to 40 millimetres of rain in some areas. The storm follows two weeks of disruptive rainfall, which has caused flooding in informal settlements, uprooted trees and power outages in some areas. Provincial Local Government spokesperson, James-Brent Styan, says the cold front is expected to last until Tuesday. “This is going to bring lots of very cold weather. In the rural areas, we want to caution people about the cold weather that can be expected, it poses a risk to people being outdoors as well as vulnerable livestock. The rainfall predicted especially in the City of Cape Town is expected to cause further challenges particularly in the low-lying areas which are already severely waterlogged due to the rainfall we’ve seen over the past two weeks,” says Styan.
