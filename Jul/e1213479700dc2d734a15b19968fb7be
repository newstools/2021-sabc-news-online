Persistent rain is taking its toll on informal settlement dwellers in Cape Town, in the Western Cape. The inclement weather led to flooding in several low-lying areas over the past week. Relief group, Gift of the Givers, stepped up the distribution of aid to informal dwellers in Strand, Valhalla Park and Philippi on Saturday. They say they responded to an outcry for help. Hundreds of shacks across the metropole took in water in more than 20 informal settlements as a series of cold fronts passed through the Cape this week. The worst affected areas included informal settlements in Khayelitsha, Gugulethu, Philippi, Strand, Masiphumelele and Hout Bay. Disaster Risk Management says teams will continue to assess the situation. The weather service says more rain is expected overnight. Strong cold front made landfall with heavy rain in Western Cape:
