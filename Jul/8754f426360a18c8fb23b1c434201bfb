The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has warned that wet, windy and cold conditions are expected in some parts of the country this week. This is the result of a cold front. Following this warning, Eskom has appealed to the public to continue using electricity sparingly. Eskom has not implemented load shedding since the 13th of June 2021 due to some improvement in the performance of the generation fleet. However, the cold front will increase the demand for electricity and put additional pressure on the power system. Media Release: Wet, windy and very cold conditions from Monday (12 July 2021). Intense cold front to bring very cold conditions to SA this week. pic.twitter.com/aytdZIPPU8 — SA Weather Service (@SAWeatherServic) July 11, 2021
