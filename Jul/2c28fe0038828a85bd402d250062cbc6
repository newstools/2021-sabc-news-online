A former prosecutor arrested for alleged corruption and defeating the ends of justice will appear in the Sibasa Regional Court outside Thohoyandou in Limpopo on Tuesday. Ratshilumela Makhado is accused of soliciting a R6 000 bribe in exchange for discarding a case of negligent driving for a suspect. Makhado’s trial has been set to start in the regional court before it can be transferred to the Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Giyani. The Sibasa regional court had to issue a warrant of arrest for Makhado following his failure to appear in court last month. He was arrested by the Hawks in an undercover operation in Thohoyandou last June. Makhado resigned as a prosecutor at the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court after his arrest. Meanwhile, another former prosecutor in Limpopo, Herbert Serumula was sentenced to four years imprisonment after he was convicted on a charge of corruption.
