United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader, Bantu Holomisa, has proposed that local government elections be postponed to between March and April next year. The Moseneke Inquiry is looking into whether free and fair elections will be possible during South Africaâ€™s local government elections amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Holomisa has told the Moseneke Inquiry that political parties under the current national disaster regulations will be constrained in campaigning and these activities are conducive to spreading the coronavirus. Holomisa says that the implications of the how many people turn up for the October 27 poll must be considered. Live proceedings in the video below:
