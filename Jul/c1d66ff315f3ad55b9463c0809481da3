As the COVID-19 numbers continue to soar, the Department of Health says it’s seeing a decline in the number of elderly people that are taking up the vaccine. This comes as the country recorded over 24 000 infections in the last reporting cycle. Gauteng education has also expressed concern over the number of educators that are refusing to take the COVID-19 jab. As more vaccines become available, it seems the appetite to vaccinate among some members of society is also declining. While the health department says it will intensify its drive to encourage the elderly to join the vaccination line, Gauteng education has also bemoaned the number of educators refusing to part take in the COVID-19 vaccination drive. Government’s Electronic Vaccination Data System has officially opened for registration of citizens aged between 50 and 59:  According to the department over 9 000 educators and support staff are refusing to be vaccinated. Nationally over three hundred and thirty thousand education personnel have already been vaccinated. Basic education had undertaken to vaccinate over half a million staff by the 8th of July. Fake news and conspiracy theories have been blamed for the lag in the vaccination drive. Teacher’s union SADTU has encouraged its members to ignore fake news and choose life. It says members must be cognisant of the labour requirements if they choose not to vaccinate. While some sectors face vaccination hesitancy, members of the security cluster are expected to start their vaccination roll out on Monday.
