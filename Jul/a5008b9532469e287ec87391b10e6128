State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo has confirmed that some of her department’s former members who are supporters of former president Jacob Zuma are key in orchestrating the current violent protests and looting in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. The video below shows, KZN Unrest:  She has dismissed as false suggestions that her department failed to provide police with intelligence that could have assisted them to foil the violent protests and looting. “There is information that doing it’s round about five people that are on a list, who are the instigators of this whole thing. We are investigating that and we will be investigating the individuals that are on the list. If you listen to Minister Cele, at no point did he say, we did not have information. That information was provided but there was not enough police and soldiers on the ground, the answer is no! There were issues of logistics as well. I don’t want to be seen as throwing Minister Cele under the bus because this is corroborated effort, Information had been flowing.” Meanwhile on Wednesday the National Chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC), Gwede Mantashe, said the current violence, looting, and vandalism that has gripped parts of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal has nothing to do with  Zuma. ANC officials in Vosloorus to assess the situation, appeal for calm:  Speaking to the media at the Chris Hani Mall in Vosloorus, Mantashe said these are thugs who are seeing an opportunity to loot. The mall has been a scene of chaos since Sunday with hundreds of looters breaking into the mall and leaving it in complete ruins
