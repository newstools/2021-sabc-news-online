 The Jacob Zuma Foundation is unhappy with the Pietermaritzburg High Court’s decision to hear the former president Jacob Zuma’s corruption trial virtually. In a media statement issued on Friday, the court says the hearing will resume at 10am on Monday. However, the Zuma foundation says it is concerned by the court’s directive as it is not consistent with provisions of both the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA) and the Constitution. The foundation is calling for the matter to be heard physically on Monday or at a later date when the country is calmer following the violence and looting that engulfed parts of Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal in recent days. The Foundation is concerned that the directions issued by the Court in PMB to hear the matter virtually are not consistent with provisions of both the CPA and the Constitution as set out below.

He is accused of benefitting from South Africa’s multi-billion rand arms procurement deal with French defence firm, Thales, in 1999. Zuma has pleaded not guilty to all 16 charges against him and describes the case as a political which-hunt. Zuma Corruption Trial | Former president pleads not guilty:
