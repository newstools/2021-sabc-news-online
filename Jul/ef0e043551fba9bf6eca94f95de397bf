Democratic Alliance (DA) leader and Member of Parliament, John Steenhuisen has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to address the nation on the latest court ruling regarding former President Jacob Zuma. Steenhuisen says it is unthinkable that Ramaphosa can “go missing at a time like this”. The DA wants him to speak out in defence of the Constitution and the independence of the judiciary which it says are increasingly under attack from elements within the African National Congress (ANC). Steenhuisen says he’s written to the Speaker of the National Assembly to request that Parliament reconvene to urgently debate Zuma’s refusal to hand himself over to begin a 15-month prison sentence. He says they are also concerned about the police’s defiance of an instruction to arrest the former President. Meanwhile, Police Minister Bheki Cele informed the office of the Chief Justice that he will hold off on the arrest of former president Jacob Zuma. In a letter penned by the State Attorney’s office on behalf of Cele, the Police Minister says this is due to the litigation steps that Zuma has embarked on.
