The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has been deployed to Soweto, Gauteng, to quell clashes between police and protestors. Violent protests continued on Tuesday morning, with some police officers sustaining injuries after being pelted with stones. Protestors took to the streets at the weekend, demanding the release of former president, Jacob Zuma, after his incarceration last week. The demonstrations have morphed into mass looting and vandalism, mostly in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Members of the SANDF have been deployed to the area to try and guard it following looting this morning. There also arrests of both men and women who were caught in the act. On Monday night, president Cyril Ramaphosa said he had authorised the SANDFâ€™s deployment to provide support to the police as the riots rage on.
