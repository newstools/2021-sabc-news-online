Wine industry representative body Vinpro’s urgent interdict application in the High Court in Cape Town, on Wednesday, has again been postponed. Vinpro wants to have the ban on the sale of alcohol lifted. The case is now expected to be heard next week. The sale of alcohol has been banned under lockdown level four. Vinpro says the previous ban had a devastating effect on the wine and tourism sector, which employs more than 269 000 people. Vinpro goes to court over ban of wine sales in Western Cape:  President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the ban in late June amid a surge in COVID-19 cases. At the time, the National Liquor Traders Council (NLTC) also responded to the news with outrage, warning that some industry members were considering defying the ban. The Beer Association of South Africa (BASA) also expressed disappointment over the Cabinet’s decision. Government is expected to review the two-week ban next week.
