The Northern Cape Health Department has concluded its investigation into allegations of patient neglect and dereliction of duty by healthcare workers at De Aar Hospital. The family of deceased Willemse van Syfer, who died of COVID-19 related complications last weekend, claims that he failed to receive proper medical care. Van Syfer’s family says that nurses were hardly available to assist the 75-year-old pensioner during his brief hospitalisation and no doctor was available following his admission last Friday. Provincial health Spokesperson Lebogang Majaha says the department is studying the report. “As a department,  we can confirm that the task team assigned to investigate the allegations at the De Aar hospital, have concluded its investigation today. It is expected that the report will be made available to the head of the department for noting and appropriate action been taken where necessary. We only feel that it will be important to meet the family and update them on this development,” says Majaha. Majaha says the report will be made available at a later stage to the general public and the media.
