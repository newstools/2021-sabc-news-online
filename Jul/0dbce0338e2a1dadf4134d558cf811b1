Suspended ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, says he will appeal the High Court’s ruling on his suspension. Earlier on Friday, the high court in Johannesburg dismissed Magashule’s application to overturn his suspension from the governing ANC. The Johannesburg court ruled that his two months suspension was lawful and valid. It also rejected Magashule’s suspension of ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa in a letter that was written to him on May 3. It found that the grounds on which Magashule sought to suspend Ramaphosa were not aligned to the requirements. Angelo Fick dissects the outcome of the case:  In a statement, Magashule describes Friday’s ruling as incorrect. He says he will continue his bid to have the ANC’s step-aside rule and the clause in the party’s constitution used to suspend him declared unlawful and unconstitutional. The ANC SG is among ANC leaders who were required to step-aside until criminal cases against them are finalised. When he didn’t temporarily vacate his office within the stipulated period, he was suspended. Magashule is facing fraud and corruption charges in the Bloemfontein Regional Court relating to a R250 million asbestos project, which the Free State government undertook while he was premier.
