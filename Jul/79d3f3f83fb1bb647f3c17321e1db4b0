The powerful Gcaba taxi family based in KwaZulu-Natal has expressed their displeasure that their family name is linked to unrest that happened in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. This comes after social media reports that the family has donated their services to transport people to the Estcourt prison as part of an effort to put pressure on the authorities to release former president Jacob Zuma. Zuma has been incarcerated at the prison to serve a 15-month sentence for contempt of court. Mandla Gcaba has distanced his family from rumoured plans for a national strike on Monday. “As Gcaba family, we are distancing ourselves. We are saying to people they must stop doing that because what they are claiming is false and they must stop spreading fake news. We got nothing to do on what they are claiming that us we are perpetuating what saying we going to do.” Gcaba says they will continue to support Zuma but within the confines of the law. “We are supporting Mr Zuma as our relative and we will continue supporting but will do that within the confines of the law. We are not going out on the prescript of the law and cause something or any anarchy or any violence or any lawless situation.” Last week, former State Security Agency top spy,  Thulani Dlomo, has handed himself over at the Durban Central Police Station. However, shortly after this, Dlomo was released without being charged. Dlomo says his lawyer called him to meet him at the station because of his intention to hand himself over to the police. His decision comes after allegations that he is among those responsible for fuelling the unrest that started in KwaZulu-Natal and spread to Gauteng. The video below speaks to Dlomo’s released without being charged:
