The African National Congress  (ANC) in the Eastern Cape is racing against time as five regional conferences still have to be concluded ahead of the local government elections in October. The Alfred Nzo, OR Tambo, Joe Gqabi, Amathole and Nelson Mandela were supposed to have held their conferences by the end of last month, but the COVID-19 pandemic has played a part in the delays. A number of branch meetings have resulted in violence and one councillor candidate was murdered in Flagstaff last month. Ward 36 in the Buffalo City Metro is the latest area in which a dispute over candidates has erupted. Snazo Mgcwaba, a member of the ANC from the ward,  is calling for the intervention of the provincial leadership.  “This issue of these BGMs that have not been held does affect us a lot as members of the organization because,  as it is, the secretary is telling us there is a candidate which we do not know of how and where they were elected and now other ANC members are saying, they will not vote for a candidate that was not elected democratically,” says Mgcwaba.
