Thirteen people have been arrested following protests in various KwaZulu-Natal areas including Empangeni. Videos have been circulating on social media showing protesters using burning tyres to barricade a number of roads in and around KwaZulu-Natal. Earlier on, former president Jacob Zuma’s daughter Dudu Zuma-Sambudla took to social media saying the protesters were supporters of her father. However, police said there was no evidence to prove this. Police Minister Bheki Cele says, “14 trucks were blocked here. Some groups of people were moving around. He’s taking the keys off both of those trucks. Thirteen of those people have been arrested. Unfortunately, there are two young ladies amongst them. From them, we found the keys of the trucks so they are part of that, so those people that are doing that, we want to expand our approach to them.” Protesters reportedly using burning tyres to barricade a number of busy roads in Empangeni:  Cliffdale, We See You!!!

The High Court in Pietermaritzburg handed down judgment on Friday. Zuma approached the court despite him already being behind bars at the Estcourt Correctional Services Facility. This after the Constitutional Court sentenced him to 15 months in jail for contempt of court after he refused to continue to testify at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture despite being ordered to do so.
