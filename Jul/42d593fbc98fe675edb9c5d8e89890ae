The N3 Toll Concession company (N3TC) has advised motorists to travel along the N3 between Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal during daylight hours wherever possible. N3TC spokesperson Thania Dhoogra says traffic is still flowing freely after the route was reopened between Heidelberg in Gauteng and Cedara outside Pietermaritzburg on Friday morning. The route is an important logistical corridor for the economy. Dhoogra says there is a highly visible law enforcement presence along the route. “While travelling on the N3 toll route, N3TC reminds road users to please remain vigilant and alert at all times. Where possible, daytime travel is recommended. Please obey all safety rules and regulations and always share the road responsible. Law enforcement continues to maintain a highly visible presence on the N3 toll route. Please follow N3 Route on Twitter or contact the 24/7 N3 helpline for official news on the N3 toll route.” The N3 was closed due to widespread looting and vandalism across Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. 12h19 17/07 #N3Traffic: There are currently no reported incidents disrupting the flow of traffic along the #N3TollRoute between Cedara I/C 96 and Heidelberg South I/C 59. Thank you for sharing the road responsibly. Please drive safely. #BuckleUp pic.twitter.com/SnjgJM0vSk — N3 Toll Concession (@N3Route) July 17, 2021
