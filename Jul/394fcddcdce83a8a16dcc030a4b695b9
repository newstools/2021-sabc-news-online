The rate of COVID-19 vaccinations in the Eastern Cape is not up to desired numbers. There is much skepticism going around, holding many back from getting the vaccine. In Nelson Mandela Bay, only 49% of the population older than 60 have been vaccinated. There is a big drive to increase the vaccination rate with the Eastern Cape Health Department aiming to vaccinate 30 000 people per day. The Nelson Mandela Bay metro is officially in the third wave. Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor, Nqaba Bhanga, says the Nelson Mandela Bay stadium is earmarked as a mass vaccination point. “Those who are over 60 are not responsive in terms of taking the vaccine. It is for that reason that we call our parents to understand  that this vaccine is an intervention to protect them against the severe attacks of COVID-19.” The target is to vaccinate 4.5 million people in the Eastern Cape. So far just over 500 000 people have been vaccinated. Spokesperson for the provincial Health Department, Sizwe Kupelo, says people must not believe the myths being peddled. “The vaccine will assist people, those over 60 and those living with chronic condition, and we are also going to do over 35. All these things that are being said about this vaccine are a myths that need to be ignored. We urge people to take this opportunity, because there comes a time where people will be in desperate need of the vaccine. “ Psychologist, Kempi van Rooyen, says a lack of trust in the vaccine is holding people back. “When you’ve got more conservative individuals, they are often older. There is a bit of a sense of distrust for authority, so there is a sense that someone will try and get something out of me and are often more reluctant to actually trust authority .” Those that have been vaccinated have no regrets. “I know people that have taken the vaccine and contracted COVID-19 but they are not so sick as others, ” says one resident. “I think they are ignorant of the fact that taking the vaccine you are more healthier, you are not putting yourself at risk nor do you put your family at risk, ” adds another. More than 700 vaccination sites are operating in the Eastern Cape.
