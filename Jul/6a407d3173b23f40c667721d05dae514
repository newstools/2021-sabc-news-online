Nearly one-million people have registered for the COVID-19 vaccine in the Western Cape. More than 770 000 vaccines have been administered across the province. Premier, Alan Winde, says they are trying to manage the limited number of vaccines available for each site. He says while walk-ins are welcome, a priority system is in place based on age. “We must also within that system have a fair and equitable mechanism that makes sure that we protect our elderly citizens. We’ve got a prioritisation system in place. Those people who are 60 and older and have not managed to register, we really want to make them a priority. So, if they walk in – we will register and vaccinate them at the same time on site. We also have a priority system that gives favour to people who are coming in the over 60 bracket for their second dose.” SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 376 398 219 057 102 451 114 667 12 345 2 939 1 590 DEATHS 5 512 15 482 11 050 2 695 1 536 86163 818 859 118 031 63 582 365 847  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 123 412 19 JULY 2021 2 302 304 67 080 14 269 993 2 069 085 7 209 221 Total Vaccination 5 328 110 13 931 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
