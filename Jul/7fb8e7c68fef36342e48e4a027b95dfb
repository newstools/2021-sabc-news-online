President Ramaphosa will be supported by the Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Dr Naledi Pandor, and that of Mineral Resources and Energy, Gwede Mantashe. President Kaunda passed away in June at the age of 97. Live stream of the funeral service for Kenneth Kaunda:  The elderly statesman succumbed to pneumonia while in a hospital in Lusaka. Following his passing, the South African government declared a period of mourning for 10 days with the national flag flying at half-mast at all flag stations. Zambia had declared 21 days. The late Zambia’s first democratically elected president post independence from Britain is hailed as one of the pioneer leaders of a new Africa, who put bigger interests ahead of personal ambition. He has also been remembered for his role in the liberation of countries in Southern Africa. Kaunda led Zambia from 1964 until 1991 when he lost power to labour leader, Fredrick Chiluba.
