The Central University of Technology (CUT) in Bloemfontein has resolved to suspend academic activities from Wednesday until next week Friday. The decision happens at a time when students have been protesting over financial challenges. On Monday, police fired stun grenades to disperse students that illegally gathered near campus. One student was arrested for allegedly violating the Disaster Management Act. Management says it also wants to avoid making students on campus becoming super-spreaders of the coronavirus. Some have been evicted by their landlords due to late payments. The management says they are processing payments and working on resolving students’ challenges. Police are on high alert at the university. CUT students in Bloemfontein continue with  protests:
