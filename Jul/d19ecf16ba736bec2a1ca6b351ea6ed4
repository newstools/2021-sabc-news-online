The South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF) has strongly condemned the attacks on journalists covering the violent unrest and looting in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. A SABC TV News crew’s vehicle was stoned in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday morning, leaving a camera operator injured, a day after the public broadcaster’s crew was robbed in Alexandra, north of Johannesburg on Sunday. A camera and vehicle belonging to Newzroom Afrika was badly damaged in Hillbrow and a News24 journalist was also threatened. SANEF’s secretary general, Mahlatse Mahlase, says reporters need to be accorded the respect and space to do their jobs. “We strongly condemn the attacks on journalists who are doing their jobs and trying to keep South Africans informed. Journalists have been working under very difficult circumstances throughout this pandemic risking their own lives. And now to have communities turn on them, steal their equipment have their cars shot really put their lives in danger. And we like to appeal to communities to be the ones that actually stand for the protection of journalist when they see them under attack,” says Mahlase. More on Sanef’s views on the matter:
