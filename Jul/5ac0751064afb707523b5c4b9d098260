The NEC says it will institute disciplinary proceedings against Niehaus within 30 days. ANC Spokesperson, Pule Mabe, was speaking during a media briefing at Luthuli House in Johannesburg. “This is the first of many other actions that the ANC will be taking – where there are acts of ill-discipline. This is not part of purging comrades, it is part of our overall efforts to drive forward the unity and renewable of the ANC. The ANC has therefore decided to institute disciplinary action against Niehaus. His membership is also temporarily suspended with immediate effect pending the institution of disciplinary proceedings.” Niehaus says he will appeal the temporary suspension.
