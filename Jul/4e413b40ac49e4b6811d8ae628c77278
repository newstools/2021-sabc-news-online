The newly-elected Mayor of the Greater Taung Local Municipality, in the North West, Grace Totong says gunshots were fired at her house in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Totong attributes this to political battles in her municipality. She was elected on Tuesday at a council sitting following the resignation of her predecessor, Oageng Seleke, last week. Seleke had replaced mayor Kgosi Nyoko Motlhabane who was ousted through a motion of no confidence in April. Totong says two bullets struck the window while she was bathing and another one struck the floor. “It’s more related to politics. I was elected as the mayor and the following day in the morning there was a shooting in my house. There are people in politics who wanted me not to be a mayor.  There was a lot of groupings. It’s clear that there was a plan by those groupings” alleges mayor Totong. She articulates her views in the audio clip below:
