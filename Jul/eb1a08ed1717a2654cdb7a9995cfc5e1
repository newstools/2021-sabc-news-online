Rand Water says at least three metros will be affected by a possible water shortage following an explosion at Rand Water’s Palmiet Booster Pumping Station in Alberton, east of Johannesburg on Sunday. The affected metros are the City of Johanneburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane. City of Tshwane Spokesperson Lindela Mashigo says it is not yet clear how long it will take to fix the problem and has called on residents to use water sparingly to avoid possible shortages. “Residents within the City of Tshwane’s jurisdiction are urged to reduce their water consumption to avoid possible water shortages following an infrastructure failure at the Rand Water’s Palmiet Booster Pumping Station. The water utility notified the City today that the said infrastructure failure has affected its station’s water pumping capacity and that it is only able to supply 55% of its normal daily water supply volume,” says Mashigo. #watersupply #palmiet #waterwise #reduceconsumption #knowbetterdobetter [LE] pic.twitter.com/EKf1qh4pix — Rand Water (@Rand_Water) July 5, 2021
