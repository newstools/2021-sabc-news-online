The Democratic Alliance (DA) in KwaZulu-Natal defended a decision by several communities in Durban who have come together to protect themselves, controlling access into the areas and manning checkpoints. The party’s Dean Macpherson says that until there are so-called meaningful police and South African National Defence Force (SANDF) troops on the ground, communities have been left to fend for themselves. Macpherson says, “I’d like to make it very clear that until such time as we see a meaningful deployment of SAPS and SANDF troops on the ground there is simply no ways that our communities cannot be left to fend for themselves that they should be at the mercy of looters at rioters these barricades and these checkpoints are the only line of defence that many of our communities have across the province and in eThekwini.” Let me be very clear on this issue as the DA. Until such time as the rule of law is established it is impossible for communities to stand down. It’s what I have informed communities & support such an approach. Once the situation improves with more police and army then we can talk https://t.co/trvQW5nWRG — Dean Macpherson (@DeanMacpherson) July 14, 2021  Another painful day on the ground with @Our_DA Leader, @jsteenhuisen visiting wards to assess the damage & thank our hero’s manning the front lines. The situation is very bad still, particularly in Phoenix & Chatsworth. We desperately need more boots on the ground. pic.twitter.com/tH47qlBSTc — Dean Macpherson (@DeanMacpherson) July 14, 2021
