The family of deceased African National Congress Member of Parliament, Joyce Maluleke, says it is still shocked by her death. The 61-year-old Maluleke died due to COVID-19 complications last week. Her husband also died of COVID-19 complications a day later. The ANC has expressed condolences. Maluleke became a Member of Parliament in 2015. She has served on various committees. She began her political career in the Limpopo Legislature, where she chaired the education committee. She was on the panel when the candidates for the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) board were interviewed. The son of the deceased, Thuli Maluleke, says it is sad to lose both parents to the pandemic. “It is bad, we are saddened.  It hurt us a lot; it is unbelievable that we lost two people.  They will be laid to rest on Saturday at 9 o’clock.” The ANC in Limpopo has sent its condolences to Joyce Maluleke’s family. ANC regional spokesperson, Donald Selamolela, says the death of their MP is a loss to the party. “Mme Joyce was our trusted leader and deployee of the African National Congress in the Parliament of the Republic serving our people with distinction at that particular level. We are saddened by the news of her passing especially that she passed away also with her husband.  We take this moment as the ANC to extend our deepest words of condolences to Mme Joyce’s family and we want to say to the family your loss is our loss, we are poorer today than we ever were due to this loss.” For Immediate Release 17 July 2021 ANC MOURNS PASSING OF  ANC MP, COMRADE JOYCE MALULEKE pic.twitter.com/Sfa5iCVoT1 — ANC Parliament (@ANCParliament) July 17, 2021
