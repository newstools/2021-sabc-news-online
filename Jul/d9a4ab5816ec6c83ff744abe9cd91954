The City of Tshwane says it has dispatched extra water tankers to areas experiencing shortages. This is as a result of an explosion at Rand Water’s Palmiet pump station in Alberton on Sunday. Affected areas include parts of Centurion, Rosslyn, Mabopane, Soshanguve and Garankuwa. The City of Joburg and Ekurhuleni are also affected.  “Tshwane has dispatched extra water tankers to areas in the City that have experienced water supply outage. In our quest to ensure that the residents get water, we procured 10 water tankers and dispatched them to parts of region 4 south of the city and they seem to be covering the area sufficiently. An additional 10 water tankers have been dispatched to some parts of Region 1, north of the City, to supplement the 22 that was dispatched yesterday due to the size of the area,” says Tshwane Spokesperson Selby Bokaba. Meanwhile, the Gauteng Health Department says it’s concerned about the ongoing water disruptions affecting some hospitals in Johannesburg and surrounding areas. Affected hospitals are Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Leratong in the West Rand, Helen Joseph and Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital. #JoburgUpdates #Eikenhof ^NN pic.twitter.com/RllAMjf0JB — Johannesburg Water (@JHBWater) May 31, 2021
