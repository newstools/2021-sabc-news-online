The African National Congress (ANC) caucus in Parliament has called on South Africans to stand up and stop the country from burning. The party held an emergency caucus meeting on Thursday of all its Members in Parliament to respond to the violent incidents of the past few days. Chief Whip, Pemmy Majodina, says MPs will work with communities in their constituencies to ensure that looting and the destruction of property are stopped. Majodina says the party supports government’s efforts to strengthen its response to the violence. “Let’s all stand up. Let’s be calm but ensure we don’t allow criminal elements in our communities to destroy the infrastructure that we have. To destroy the jobs that other people have. We are looking forward to work with you as citizens. As members of parliament of the ANC we’ll be operating from the constituencies where we are allocated,” urges Majodina. ANC officials in Vosloorus to assess the situation, appeal for calm:  Calls for an end to the looting have been made by various quarters in the country, including pastors and the Democracy Our Democracy Campaign. The campaign briefed the media on Thursday and called for authorities to hold the people who instigated the riots to account for the deaths of the more than 70 South Africans whose lives were lost during the mayhem.
