Dhoogra says members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) are being deployed on the route. “The N3 remains closed from Cedara in KZN to Harrismith in the Free State. The SANDF have been mobilised and are being deployed on the route. In consultation with law enforcement agencies, plans are being put in place to prepare for the re-opening of the route…” says Dhoogra. “Apart from ensuring safety and security along the N3, urgent maintenance work including recovery, cleanup and repairs – is required before the road can be safely reopened,” she added. 10h00 15/07 #TrafficAlert: #N3TollRoute between #Cedara and #Harrismith is CLOSED to all traffic for #safety & #security until further notice.

Some members of the South African National Taxi Council in KwaZulu-Natal have come together to clean up the debris left behind by the looting. The Council has also spoken out against some of its members whose vehicles have been involved in looting activities. “Our leadership has taken the initiative to clean up the cities that are affected,” says Provincial Manager Sifiso Shangase. It is not only Durban but we have started in Durban and the objective of the initiative is to save KwaZulu-Natal from what is happening right now and this is going to probably lead to a possibility whereby once the roads are clean, the minibus taxis will then be in a position to go back to their operation,” says Shangase.
