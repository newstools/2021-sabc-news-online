Former US President Donald Trump announced plans to sue tech giants Google, Twitter and Facebook claiming that he is the victim of censorship. Trump’s social media accounts were suspended in January over public safety concerns in the wake of the Capitol riots, led by his supporters. Trump was speaking during a news conference from his golf resort in New Jersey. “Today, with the America First Policy Institute, I am filing a major class action lawsuit against the big tech giants including Facebook, Google and Twitter as well as their CEOs, Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai,” said Trump. “We are demanding an end to the shadow banning, a stop to the silencing and the blacklisting, banishing and cancelling that you all know so well,” he added.
