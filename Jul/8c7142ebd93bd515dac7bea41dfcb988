State Security Minister, Ayanda Dlodlo, has confirmed they are investigating information as to whether senior former agents in the agency and senior ANC members aligned to former president Jacob Zuma are responsible for igniting the recent violence in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Dlodlo was part of the Justice and Crime Prevention Cluster panel, which briefed the media in Pretoria on Tuesday. Dlodlo says she received information relating to certain people and are verifying the information. She denied that the intelligence community did not react fast enough to prevent the plundering and violence. “As you would have noticed the target was very fast moving, we tried or best where ever we could, and we averted a lot more than what you see on national television because of the proactive stance that was taken by intelligence services of the three ministries but also the work done by police to avert greater crime that could have occurred,” she says. Police Minister, Bheki Cele, has assured the public that the police working with the intelligence and SANDF members will quell the riots that have seen shops looted and property vandalised. Police arrive at Queen Nandi Drive in Durban as a sea of looters march down towards Umgeni road. There are several shops on the strip. #SAShutdown #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/azZAIvt5SU — Jayed-Leigh Paulse (@JayedLeigh) July 13, 2021  [HAPPENING NOW] Soldiers have closed off the gates to the looted Diepkloof Square.#SABCNEWS pic.twitter.com/GKLFqnZFj7 — Chriselda ‘Babes We Ndaba’ Lewis (@Chriseldalewis) July 13, 2021  At least 757 arrests have so far been made and 10 people have lost their lives during the riots.
