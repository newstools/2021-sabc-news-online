Rand Water says it is still unclear at this stage as to when the Palmiet booster pumping station in Alberton, south of Johannesburg, will be fully operational. This follows an explosion at the pump station on Sunday. At this stage it’s still unclear when the repairs will be concluded. Rand water spokesperson, Justice Mohale, says: “The municipalities that have been affected are the City of Johannesburg, Tshwane and Ekurhuleni.  When it comes to the resumption, I cannot guarantee [that] because we [are] going to have to wait for our technical team and engineers to say we have done the job. They also have to do the quality control before they open up for those motors to start working.” #watersupply #palmiet #waterwise #reduceconsumption #knowbetterdobetter [LE] pic.twitter.com/f1eGjrqSjo — Rand Water (@Rand_Water) July 7, 2021  On Tuesday, the City of Tshwane dispatched extra water tankers to areas experiencing shortages.
