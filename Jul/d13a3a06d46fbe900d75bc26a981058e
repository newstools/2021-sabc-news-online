Former African National Congress (ANC) Councillor in Nelson Mandela Bay, Andile Lungisa, says the party did not follow the right processes in suspending him. The ANC’s Provincial Disciplinary Committee slapped Lungisa with an 18-month suspension, this follows his two-year sentence for hitting Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor Rayno Kayser with a jug. Lungisa was charged with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and only served two months of his sentence. The committee has also instructed Lungisa to attend anger management classes for 12 months. However, Lungisa says his suspension is a violation of the party’s constitution. “You must remember in the ANC, we go through the DC process, Ngcukaitobi must respect the DC process as I respected the DC process. It becomes a DC which gives a verdict, a verdict a person is given internal remedy to be able to appeal. There can be no letter or anything else which is issued. It’s only a DC process if a member is taken to a DC process. He only responds to that outcome. We must never allow individuals in the Eastern Cape to violate the ANC constitution,” says Lungisa.
