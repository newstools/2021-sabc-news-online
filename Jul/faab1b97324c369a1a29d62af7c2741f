The office of the Public Protector says it is yet to read the Constitutional Court judgment that Justice Chris Jafta has delivered. The judgment is scathing on advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s findings on donations made to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s 2017 ANC presidential campaign. Former Democratic Alliance leader and now One South Africa Movement leader Mmusi Maimane first raised the issue in Parliament in 2018 when he asked Ramaphosa about the R500 000 donation that Bosasa had made to his campaign. Justice Chris Jafta says Mkhwebane was wrong in her findings when she said Ramaphosa had misled Parliament when he responded to the question from Maimane. The Head of Legal Services in the office of the Public Protector, Muntu Sithole, says: “We were obviously expecting a positive outcome. These are issues of Constitutional importance that had to be decided by this court, and if the court finds against us, they will have to take it to the team because is the Apex court, you can’t appeal. But you will notice that we also have descending judgment on the matter, Mogoeng Mogoeng being with us on the issues that we have raised.” Constitutional Court rules on Ramaphosa’s CR17 campaign: Maimane says while there is no denying that a donation was made towards Ramaphosa’s campaign, he agrees with the court that Mkhwebane’s investigation went beyond what they had asked her to do. pic.twitter.com/6PRzXf1SUG — Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) July 1, 2021
