The President’s address will follow meetings of the National Coronavirus Command Council, the President’s Coordinating Council and Cabinet. NICD calls for lockdown restrictions not to be relaxed: The National Institute for Communicable Diseases  (NICD) says relaxing some of the restrictions of alert level four lockdown at this stage would not be a good idea as the number of coronavirus infections is still rising. The country has recorded 21 610 new coronavirus infections in the past 24-hour cycle, taking the total number of cases to 2 179 297. Acting executive director of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases Professor Adrian Puren says non-pharmaceutical interventions still need to be heightened. “Given the numbers the trajectories I think it would be a difficult decision to say to have some modified and lessened level 4 or even moving to level 3. I think the key is still ensuring implementation of none pharmaceutical interventions still remain and need to be heightened. The physical distancing.” Latest SA stats: SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 368 975 213 266 92 396 106 583 12 079 2 827 1 535 DEATHS 5 414 14 377 10 871 2 584 1 449 86163 763 653 110 058 61 806 346 202  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 119 719 11 JULY 2021 2 195 599 64 289 13 901 847 1 922 601 16 302 151 Total Vaccination 4 236 718 13 002 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
