Founder of the social media group Rebuild KZN, Tatum Ridgeway, says South Africans have come together in a phenomenal way to support each other through the looting crisis. Communities across the country are protecting their key infrastructure and supporting the police and army. Others are cleaning up malls and shops targetted by looters. Ridgeway says people are reaching out to one another. “What was intended to break us, what was intended to separate us, has brought people together like never before. On the Facebook page, you see people from all races offering help. The Muslim community offering food, the taxi association cleaning the streets of Durban, and people are posting that this isn’t about race. It is basically the good people of South Africa rebuilding and protecting what is there’s. We’ve had people post on the page – I need baby formula urgently, I need certain things. Someone yesterday said they were looking for meat and someone gave them bread in return for some meat. Not only on the page, but it has also been incredible to witness this sense of community that has developed.” Clean-up operations continue Meanwhile, clean-up operations are continuing in Soweto following mass-scale thievery at various shopping centres in the township and other parts of Gauteng. Calm has been restored and with the help of community members, law enforcement officials are busy recovering some of the stolen goods. At Bara Mall in Soweto, some residents are helping with the cleaning of the looted businesses. And some street vendors are back at their stalls trying to sell what’s left of their stock. In Orlando, some residents are making use of spaza shops to get basic supplies such as bread, milk, and cold drinks. Calm has been restored in the township and police continue to patrol the area.
