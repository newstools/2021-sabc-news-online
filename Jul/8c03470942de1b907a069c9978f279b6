The police have recorded a total of 770 cases of vigilantism or mob justice in the first three months of 2021. The head of the police’s social crime prevention unit, Major General Thokozani Mathonsi, during a webinar said the COVID-19 pandemic impacted severely on the police’s social crime prevention programmes. Mathonsi admitted that some communities take the law into their own hands because they do not trust the local police, but said the police are addressing these issues. He says communities must understand that the police need evidence before they can arrest a person. “There is no justice about vigilantism. But instead it perpetuates further criminality and contributes to violence. For instance during the fourth quarter of the last financial year, which will be January 2 to March, for instance from our side, we recorded 298 murders emanating from mob justice, 69 attempted murders, 403 assault GBH, which is grievous bodily harm, which means serious assault,” says Mathonsi.
