Minister for Commerce, Industry and Trade in Eswatini, Manqoba Khumalo says some businesses have resumed their operations after they were affected by recent violent protest action. This after the Eswatini government issued a statement calling on business people and residents to return to work. Khumalo also says the internet has been restored after it was shut down by the government following reports that the riots were instigated by some people from neighbouring countries. “It is true that several infrastructures were targeted and were damaged including telecoms infrastructure. But it is also true that our security intelligence was telling us that there were foreign agents.  Some of them from neighbouring countries and some of them from beyond,[working] to orchestrate, raise funds and mobilise for violence against this country.” On Sunday, The Southern African Development Community, SADC has urged the people of the Kingdom of eSwatini to engage in dialogue to resolve the impasse that led to a week of pro-democracy protests. A SADC delegation, which is in the landlocked kingdom on a fact-finding mission, has expressed concern about the disruption of economic activity during the pro-democracy protests. Botswana President and Chairperson of the SADC Troika, Doctor Mogweetsi Masisi was accompanied by Botswana International Relations Minister Doctor Lemohang Kwape on a visit to Eswatini. They met with Eswatini Acting Prime Minister Themba Masuku. Masuku reported that the national damage is currently estimated at R3 billion and this has resulted in about 5 000 job losses. People’s United Democratic Movement (Pudemo) has since reported it suspended the violence and embarked on a national stay away.
