Member of the Mayoral Committee for Utilities in the City of Tshwane, Phillip Nel, says the northern part of the affected area might come online by lunch-time today after the Wapadrand substation caught fire. Teams have been removing the damaged panels. Some underground cables were also damaged. The neighbourhoods to the south of the sub-station, like Faerie Glen, Boardwalk and Koedoespoort, might only have power restored by Tuesday.
