Twitter has suspended the account of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema for 12 hours after his recent tweets regarding the violent protests and looting in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng. Malema took to Twitter saying if the government deployed members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), his ground forces would have to come out in numbers and take to the streets. Twitter says this statement has the potential to incite violence. Malema who will not tweet, or retweet, will only send inbox messages to his followers until his suspension has been lifted. Other social media users have since criticised the EFF leader for his comments.  So @Twitter has temporarily suspended the account of CiC @Julius_S_Malema for tweeting #NoToSoldiers & stating the fact that “War is declared on civilians”?. The white capitalist establishment is desperate to protect their puppet who’s failing to provide leadership! pic.twitter.com/ouOfD3RTvr — Floyd Shivambu (@FloydShivambu) July 13, 2021   War declared on civilians — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) July 12, 2021   I never thought I would see the day where Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi & Sentletse providing better leadership than Julius Malema and Zihle Zikalala on condemning violence. — African Renaissance (@MadiBoity) July 13, 2021   SANDF must deal with looters. We don’t care about feelings of Malema. — African Renaissance (@MadiBoity) July 12, 2021
