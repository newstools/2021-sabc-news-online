The province is urging everyone to adhere strictly to protective behaviour to contain the spread of the virus. The province has recorded 2 447 new cases in the past 24-hours. The province presented its weekly digital briefing on COVID-19. With about 200 vaccination sites throughout the province, the Western Cape hopes to open several more mass vaccination centres in the coming weeks. Health Department authorities are calling on everyone to observe safety protocols and for everyone eligible to register to be vaccinated. Head of Department of the province’s Health Department, Dr Keith Cloete, says there’s a 51% week-on-week increase in infections. “Admissions are currently about 135 new admissions per day and we are currently recording about 25 deaths per day. So, that’s the picture of rapid increase in the province. If we take the metro, it’s a 44% increase week-on-week, all sub-districts have now shown marked increases in places. Most cases are predominantly diagnosed in the private sector, but the public sector cases are also now increasing.”
