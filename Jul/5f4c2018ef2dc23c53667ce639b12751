The re-opened inquest into the death of Dr Neil Aggett resumes on Thursday for closing arguments at the High Court in Johannesburg. Two days have been set aside for the virtual hearing, as courts are operating under strict lockdown regulations. The medical doctor and trade unionist died in police custody on the 5th of February 1982, after 70 days in detention. Aggett was found hanging in his cell at the Johannesburg Central Police Station, formerly known as the infamous John Vorster Square. An initial inquest, in 1982, had ruled that he had committed suicide. However, Aggett’s family say he was murdered by the security police. A former security branch police officer, Martin Naudé, has previously conceded that it’s possible that Aggett was assaulted a month before he died. More on that in the video below:
