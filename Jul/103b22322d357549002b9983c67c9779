The Free State Department of Health has expressed concern about a peak in COVID-19 infections over the past two weeks. The Health Department says the province has been recording over 500 daily infections in the last week. Health spokesperson Mondli Mvambi says however the department has enough beds in healthcare facilities. Mvambi has encouraged those registered to vaccinate. “For 60 years and older the target has been two hundred and eighty-eight thousand and we are now at 45 percent. We need to get more of these senior citizens to the vaccination sites.  There are many theories at why this is happening, others are saying that the older persons are not allowed by their next of kin who are holding their IDs or means of getting into the vaccination sites. Many people are still playing wait and see.” Residents views on vaccine roll out Some Free State residents have expressed their views on the vaccine roll out in the province. One resident says, “I went to the hospital and I was helped with my ID that’s all. There are other people who are getting negative information that go there and you must first register and wait for what, of which is not like that.” Another resident says, “I will encourage everybody to take the vaccine because I feel it is safe for everybody. I’m not vaccinated myself but when my turn comes I will vaccinate.” Another person eligible for the vaccine says they are dreading the long queues. “I cannot stand there the whole day.”
