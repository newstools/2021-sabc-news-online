South Africans have taken to social media to react to the unrest happening in parts of the country. Protesters in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng have taken to the streets demanding the release of former President Jacob Zuma. Zuma is serving a 15 months sentence after the Constitutional Court found him guilty of contempt of court. So far, 166 suspects have been arrested in KwaZulu-Natal and 323 suspects arrested in Gauteng relating to these incidents. Under the hashtags including  #ShutdownSA, #ShutDownGauteng, #ShutdownKZN, and #Zumaunrest users have been expressing their views about the situation the country is facing.  While some have been calling for Alert Level 5 lockdown to deal with the current situation others are completely against stricter measures. Lockdown without a clear medical and economic plan is destructive. You can't confine people to their homes, deny them the right to work, deprive them from an income, without providing them with an amount equal to their income. #level5 — Christo  (@ChristoThurston) July 10, 2021  Hit a like if you suffer from lockdown exhaustion, fatigue & depression#level5 pic.twitter.com/0BXsvspVKm — LoneWolf (@JabaMogomotsi) July 10, 2021   #level5 do you think levels are working?

We dont have money to buy electricity pic.twitter.com/H3ptUtvl9a — Grateful (@lwanelersa) July 10, 2021   President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday announced the deployment of the South African National Defence Force in support of the operations of the South African Police Service. Let's hope the Deployment of the #SANDF to assist the South African Police Service will produce the results, and they will be no bloodshed. #ShutdownSA#ShutDownGauteng#PrayForSouthAfrica pic.twitter.com/vIBPU9HUNE — Kag'sow_M (@NjabuloMtsenga) July 12, 2021   I hope #SANDF is not heading to KZN Let alone Gauteng. — MADUMETŠA (@TeffuJoy) July 12, 2021   Stop calling for the #SANDF! There will be bloodshed #SAShutdown pic.twitter.com/MPjqsf4heI — Ibanathi Ngcobo (@ibanathi) July 12, 2021  The Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has urged South Africans to say no to the deployment of soldiers. He has also warned against calls for a state of emergency. No soldiers on our streets! Otherwise, we are joining. All fighters must be ready… they won't kill us all. We need a political solution to a political problem, not soldiers.#NoToSoldiers — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) July 12, 2021  Others share the same sentiment. SANDF are not trained to control crowd. #NoToSoldiers — Man’s NOT Barry Roux  (@AdvoBarryRoux) July 12, 2021   #NoToSoldiers, there was never army deployment in Senekal. pic.twitter.com/DWzO2QoY3k — Brian M Tloubatla (@_BrianTloubatla) July 12, 2021   When soldiers were deployed during level 5, how did that go? Remember Collins Khoza.#NoToSoldiers — Sixo Gcilishe (@SixoGcilishe) July 12, 2021  Some malls have taken precautionary measures. The safety and security of our shoppers and tenants is of the utmost importance to Mall of Africa. Additional security measures have been put in place. 2/3 — Mall Of Africa (@TheMallOfAfrica) July 12, 2021   South Gate Mall has asked people to go home. They are closing down until its safe. Protesters are on their way there. — Nkanyezi (@NkanyeziKubheka) July 12, 2021  Since some shopping centres have been closed as the result of the looting, shoppers will now have to go far to get goods. Unfortunately the malls being looted and subsequently destroyed are our places of proximity for goods and services. The privilege of walking across the road to buy at Jabulani Mall replaced the double transport of going to South gate but here we are, retreating to that system. — Lawfluencer (@L_Nthodi_Law) July 12, 2021   People of Alex vandalizing their own township, looting and destroying all the shops that gives them food, tomorrow they'll complain about lack of service delivery. #GautengShutdow #ShutDownGauteng #Sandton pic.twitter.com/pvCq2IKW7I — Nyameko (@Nemza13) July 11, 2021  While the police and the SANDF work to restore order, others are counting their losses. It is painful looking at this brother who lost his business…This reminds me of the day when thieves came and stole at our restaurant… The demotivation to build again from scratch was just overwhelming…#ShutDownGauteng #ShutdownSA pic.twitter.com/R8y6FHKr1Q — Fada Tshego (@FadaTshego) July 13, 2021   #SABCNEWS This car dealership owner lost 58 vehicles that were burned on Sunday during the riots and looting in Jeppestown. He estimates the damage to run to millions. pic.twitter.com/wCDvyUzGNM — Tshepo (@tphagane) July 13, 2021   [WARNING: VERY STRONG LANGUAGE] VIDEO | Workers at a mall in Diepkloof, Soweto express anger and frustration following the looting at the mall, leaving them without a workplace to go to.  #looting #GautengShutdownhttps://t.co/b4Zi2hXHNB — SABC News (@SABCNews) July 13, 2021   11 more fatalities have been recorded since the beginning of the #zumaprotests bringing the total number of deaths to 18.
