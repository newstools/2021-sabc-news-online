South African government intelligence body, the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (Nat Joints) says 72 people have now been confirmed to have died in the spate of looting and violence that has hit Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal. Nat Joints says the total number of people arrested has risen to 1 232. 549 people were arrested in KwaZulu-Natal and 683 in Gauteng. Nat Joints has also sent condolences to the family of deceased EMPD officer Meshack Mahlangu and wished the police members hurt while dealing with the looting and violence a speedy recovery. Nat Joints spokesperson Brenda Muridili says: “With the recent deployment of the Defence Force members and the augmentation of law enforcement officers by the recalling of SAPS members from leave and rest days, more boots have been on the ground to police the rampant elements of criminality perpetuated by the looting of businesses and destruction of property.” Role of the SANDF deployed in parts of Gauteng and KZN: Darren Olivier
