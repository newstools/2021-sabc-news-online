Some members of the uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) say the African National Congress (ANC) NEC did not listen to them when they warned the ruling party that there will be unrest and bloodshed in the country if former President Jacob Zuma was to be arrested. Zuma filed an urgent application at the Constitutional Court on Friday afternoon to rescind its judgment and warrant for his committal to prison. On Tuesday, the Constitutional Court sentenced him to 15 months imprisonment for contempt of court. Addressing a media briefing surrounded by scores of ANC supporters outside Zuma’s home in Nkandla, the MKMVA’s Carl Niehaus said arresting Zuma will cause instability. “On the 18th August last year we issued a lengthy press statement which we sent to the NEC of the ANC that there is a continuation of the targeting of Zuma. We warned the NEC of the ANC and the judges in the constitutional court and also the deputy chief justice Mr Zondo that if cool heads and minds do not prevail. If President Zuma continue to be targeted and if President Zuma is eventually sent to prison that our country will be torn apart. That violence will be inevitable because of this.” VIDEO: Niehaus addresses press briefing: Supporters Some supporters from other provinces are expected back at Zuma’s home on Saturday. A group of Zuma supporters from Mpumalanga province wearing pro-Zuma and ANC regalia say they are angry about the recent Constitutional Court judgment. Deputy Convenor of the ANC’s eHlanzeni region, Ngray Ngwenya says, “We are here to support Zuma, I am not happy. Why De Klerk was given a fine, why not Zuma? Zuma did not kill anyone. Why he is not given fine? If he was given fin I would be happy. I am here to support Zuma from Mpumalanga, he is our father and an old man.” Zuma’s supporters speak to SABC News: Meanwhile, amid building tensions the ANC has cancelled an NEC meeting which was to be held at the weekend in Durban to deal with the situation.
