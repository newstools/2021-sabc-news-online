The Information Regulator of South African says it is still awaiting the Correctional Services Department’s response to the distribution of photographs of former president Jacob Zuma through social media. The regulator recently requested an update on the matter and the department took steps to mitigate any alleged breach of the Protection of Personal Information Act. The pictures were taken at the Estcourt Correctional Centre where Zuma has been admitted to serve his 15-month sentence. In the video below, Correctional Services assures that Zuma will not receive any preferential treatment:   The regulator says a picture forms part of personal information. It says the Act prohibits the distribution of personal information without the consent of the individual identified in the item being distributed. “The Information Regulator has not received a reply from the Department of Correctional Services, but I am certain that the correspondence is receiving the necessary attention. We shall await the opportunity to engage the Department of Correctional Services on this important matter – and ensure that continuous awareness campaign is performed to ensure that further data breaches are prevented,” says Information Regulator Counsellor Advovate Collin Weapond.
