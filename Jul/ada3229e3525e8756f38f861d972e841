A suspect has been arrested in connection with the murder of a 46-year-old woman in Mkhazini near KwaMakhutha south of Durban. It is alleged that the suspect stabbed and killed his wife during an argument at their home. The SABC received a tip-off from a listener regarding the whereabouts of the suspect and notified the police. The suspect, who was arrested after being found hiding in Nquthu in northern KwaZulu-Natal, will appear in the Mbumbulu Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says, “This is after an incident that took place last week where a 46-year-old woman was allegedly killed by her husband and he fled the area. After the intensive and sleepless night of the detectives from KwaMakhutha they proceeded to Estcourt where he was said to be hiding. On arrival, he was not found and then the information led them to Nquthu where he was also in hiding.” GBV in South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa voiced his concerns about the increasing cases of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in South Africa. During a hybrid sitting of the National Assembly, where he answered oral questions on various issues affecting the country, Ramaphosa said measures have been put in place to ensure the backlogs at forensics science labs are eradicated. Reflecting on 3rd anniversary of SA’s first GBV and femicide summit  Ramaphosa said, “I am deeply worried about the continuing spate of GBV cases and we want to ensure not only laws passed, but also implemented, do take place. We need to take this seriously because really it’s a blight on our nation.” The spike in GBV since the start of the lockdown has sent shockwaves across the country. In the first week of the lockdown last year, the South African Police Service (SAPS) recorded 2 300 complaints of GBV. Additional reporting by: Nonhlakanipho Magwaza
