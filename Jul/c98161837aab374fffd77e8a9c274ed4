Controversial businessmen Atul and Rajesh Gupta have not yet been added to International Criminal Police Organization’s (Interpol) Red Notice list as previously confirmed by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). Back pedalling from Monday’s statement – the NPA says that Red Notices are circulating amongst Interpol member states’ law enforcement, but the body itself is still reviewing the application. The two brothers and their wives are wanted in connection to the Free State Agriculture department’s procurement fraud amounting to R25 million. Free State Corruption | Interpol red notices issued against Atul Gupta and others: Sindisiwe Seboka  NPA Spokesperson Sindisiwe Seboka says four of the Gupta associates from India have been issued with the notices. “Red Notices for the four Gupta family members are still under consideration by the Commission for the Control of Interpol’s Files (CCF). The CCF is an independent legal body that ensures that all personal data processed through Interpol’s channels conforms to the Interpol Constitution. We are confident that these notices do not violate the requirements of Article 3 in that they are neither politically motivated nor of a military, religious or racial character,” says Seboka.
