Former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede has opened a case of crimen injuria at the Mtshebheni police station in Inanda north of Durban. This is after social media posts saying that she is one of the instigators of unrest and looting that gripped KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng in the past week. SABC News reporter Vusi Khumalo spoke to Gumede at the Inanda police station:  Gumede and her lawyer, Bulelani Mazomba, met with police behind closed doors. Mazomba says they have provided the police with printouts of social media posts together with a sworn statement by Gumede. Gumede, who is currently a member of the KwaZulu-Natal legislature, says she is being falsely accused by faceless people. “I cannot run to anywhere. The only place I can run to is the police station because I am telling you these are pure, pure lies. But they need to be investigated so that these people who are doing it, will never ever do it again.” Gumede has expressed her sympathy to those who have suffered losses in the unrest. “I wish to take this opportunity to commit my support, sympathy, and assistance to people who have suffered the loss of either loved ones or financially on these things that have been happening recently. I really feel so bad about what has happened, as a member of the public, as a mother, as a grandmother, and as a member of the African National Congress.”
