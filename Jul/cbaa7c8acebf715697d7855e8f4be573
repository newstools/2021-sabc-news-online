President Cyril Ramaphosa is engaging with leaders of different sectors of society to develop a response to the widespread violence and destruction of property in some parts of the country. Later on Wednesday morning, he will meet with leaders of different political parties represented in the National Assembly. On Tuesday night, Ramaphosa met with religious leaders from the different faith communities. That meeting was preceded by talks with the National Security Council and another with business leaders on Monday, in which the president was accompanied by several ministers. The president’s move comes amid severe criticism about government’s response to the unrest, with the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) saying it has revealed weak political leadership. The unrest was sparked by the incarceration of former president Jacob Zuma, who is serving 15 months behind bars for defying a Constitutional Court order.

IRMSA says there have always been fears of social unrest and a possible increase in crime, due to unemployment, loss of income and poverty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. It says a quicker government response and strong leadership are what is needed to bring the current situation under control. The institute’s Thabile Nyaba elaborates in the video below:
