The African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo has recalled the mayor of Thulamela Local Municipality, Avhashoni Tshifhango, from his position. Tshifhango has been removed over the R30 million the Thohoyadou-based municipality invested in the now defunct VBS Mutual Bank. Though the deposit was later withdrawn with interests before the bank collapsed, the ANC says the decision was not in line with the law. ANC spokesperson, Donald Selamolela, says Tshifhango has been replaced. “The ANC provincial executive committee had on a special meeting held on Wednesday took a decision to withdraw and replace comrade Avhashoni Tshifhango as the mayor of Thulamela municipality and replace him with  Humbulani Mulovhedzi who is the current speaker of Thulamela municipality,” adds Tshifhango. Selamolela adds that the ANC will from time to time take steps against its deployees whose municipalities also irregularly invested in VBS. “We continue to review reports and process them as they come in relation to this particular matter of the VBS. We committed to you as the media houses that whenever we get further information in any other matter we will continue to process to those particular matters. When we release the seven matters earlier, a year or two years ago, we have made this commitment we continued to live up to that commitment,” he explains. The investigation into the VBS scandal has been ongoing:  On Wednesday, the Hawks said more arrests in connection to the VBS scandal were imminent. Three former Gauteng municipal executives appeared briefly at the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in connection with the ongoing VBS probe. All three accused were released on R50 000 bail each and will return to court on October 22.
