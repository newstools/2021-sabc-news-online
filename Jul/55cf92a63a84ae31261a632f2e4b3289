A newly adopted Constitution 18th Amendment Bill will be published for public comment for the next three weeks. This resolution was taken by the Ad Hoc Committee to Amend Section 25 of the Constitution to Expropriate land without Compensation. The Democratic Alliance (DA), Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF) and  Freedom Front Plus(FF Plus)  gave different reasons for objecting to the publication of the Bill which was the majority decision of the African National Congress. The deliberations on the Bill also saw the rejection of some of the proposals of the EFF, Al Jama-Ah and the Freedom Front Plus to change certain clauses in Section 25. The proposed amendments made by the ANC were approved. Ad Hoc Committee Chairperson Mathole Motshekga says an agreement was made and this is a supplementary process to complete work. “Honourable members, I think we have agreed on publication of the Bill informed on what came from our debate and public hearings. So this is really a supplementary process to complete our work. This new Bill –  we have voted to invite the public to make supplementary submissions. And for supplementary submissions, we allocate three weeks.” VideoExpropriation of the land bill to be published for written public comments
