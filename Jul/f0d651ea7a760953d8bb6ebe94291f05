The Northern Cape family of a man who died of COVID-19 complications at De Aar Hospital has accused the hospital of negligence. The mourning family members allege that their 75-year-old father, who died over the weekend, was not given proper medical care. They also say that nurses abandoned their stations and that there was no doctor to attend to him after his admission. The family of 75-year-old Willemse van Syfer says that he was left to die alone. They also claim that there is no enforcement of COVID-19 regulations at the De Aar Hospital. The deceased’s son says he was forced to go to the hospital and feed his father during his hospitalization. They say nurses who admitted Van Syfer were not wearing protective gear and all COVID-19 protocols were violated. His distraught daughter, Ureca Pegram says they want answers. “My father was admitted at De Aar Hospital on Friday after he tested positive for COVID-19 and from admission the service was already inhumane and pathetic. From the time when my father was admitted, there was no doctor who could assist. The bed he was used was broken, they were not even protective gear,” says Pegram. Northern Cape Health Department Spokesperson, Leboganga Majaha says the department is investigating the allegations against the hospital. “As the Northern Cape Department of Health, we view this matter in serious light following this alleged incident at the De Aar Hospital. The HOD immediately established a task team, comprising of senior managers to undertake an investigation into this matter. We anticipate the investigation to be completed by the end of this week. Further details will be shared with the public,” says Majaha. The wife of the deceased is also COVID-19 positive and currently being treated at home. The family says their mother was refused treatment by the same hospital. They say their loved ones would still be alive if healthcare workers were diligent and compassionate.
