Another strong cold front is expected to make landfall in the Western Cape from around midday on Thursday. A forecaster from the Weather Office in Cape Town, Kate Turner, says the rain and cold conditions will then spread along the West Coast as well as across to the Eastern parts of the Western Cape. She says the rain will be preceded by a strong northwester that could cause structural damage. “We do have a warning out for rain, a yellow level two for localised flooding, mainly over the metropole, as well as the Drakenstein, Stellenbosch and Theewaterskloof municipalities for Thursday.” “Ahead of the cold front we are expecting strong winds starting to pick up through the day, a northwester peaking between 60-70 kilometres per hour across the Western Cape, as well as southern interior of the Northern Cape,” adds Turner.
