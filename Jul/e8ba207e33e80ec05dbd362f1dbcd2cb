Contract workers affiliated to the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (Numsa) have not reported for duty at the Impala Platinum Mine in Rustenburg, in the North West, despite their expected return to their posts this week. The Numsa members allege that they are being prevented by their colleagues who are affiliated to rival union, Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union( Amcu). They say Amcu is forcing them to join the union before they can be allowed to report to work. ” (A) Numsa member who want to go inside they have to sign a contract with Amcu. The workers are heart broken because they did not get paid because of the stop orders signed by Amcu. Clock cards are blocked. Other mine workers are working. We had a meeting with the  security. We agreed that they will talk to the management and revert but we have not received a feedback,” says  one of the disgruntled mineworkers, Wesley Lekhobe. Amcu is yet to respond to the accusations. The Numsa affiliates had been on strike demanding, among others, salary increases, living out allowances and medical aids. Recently, over 4 000 of their comrades employed by four companies contracted to Impala Platinum Mine were sacked by their employers while on strike.
