Inkatha Freedom Party leader Velenkosini Hlabisa says while his party is ready to go the elections, he believes it is better to err on the side of caution and hold the elections in May next year. He was addressing the Moseneke Inquiry into the feasibility of holding the local government elections during the pandemic. The elections are scheduled for October 27. Hlabisa says for parties like his, whose core constituency is the disadvantaged and rural, it will be difficult and costly to hold online meetings and gatherings for the purposes of candidate selection. He says efforts to reach the electorate to campaign will also be severely constrained during the pandemic. Holomisa has told the Moseneke Inquiry that political parties under the current national disaster regulations will be constrained in campaigning and these activities are conducive to spreading the coronavirus. Holomisa says that the implications of how many people turn up for the October 27 poll must be considered. Live proceedings in the video below:
