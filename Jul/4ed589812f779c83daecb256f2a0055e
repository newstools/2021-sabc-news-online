Premier Alan Winde says the differentiated approach will provide a balance between saving lives and saving livelihoods. “I cannot believe that we have a one size fits all for the whole of South Africa where KZN is not even in a third wave technically as yet, and of course Gauteng at the peak. The Western Cape now climbing we need to make sure that we are dealing with the balance correctly between regions across our province and across our country.” The province is expected to reach the peak of infections by the end of July and the first week in August.
