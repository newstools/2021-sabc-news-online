The City of Cape Town says it has made about 300 assessments in areas affected by flooding following heavy rain in the Western Cape last week. Localised flooding affected thousands of people living in informal settlements including Mfuleni, Kraaifontein, Dunoon and Khayelitsha. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, says because of the low-lying terrain and the multiple severe storms, the water takes some time to dissipate. He says they have provided about 2 500 flood assistance packets. Smith says they have also given out materials and other support where it has been possible to do so but this is not possible on illegally occupied land. “In about 70% of all new unlawfully occupied areas, feasible flood mitigation is not possible due to the low-lying terrain, including floodplains, wetlands and waterlogged areas. The spike in unlawful occupations since the start of the March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown is causing severe challenges on the ground. We can see from the high levels of flooding incidents and where they have occurred,” he adds. Below is the full weather report:
