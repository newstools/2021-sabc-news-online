The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) says it will forge ahead with its Constitutional Court challenge against the AARTO system. Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula announced the national roll out of the AARTO system today which will culminate in the point’s demerit system which will come into effect from the 1st of July next year. In terms of the demerit system, motorists will be allocated 15 points and each time they violate a traffic law they lose points, which could eventually result in them losing their driver’s license. Mbalula says this is aimed at addressing lawlessness on the road and to ensure motorists adhere to road safety rules. OUTA’s Wayne Duvenage says there are still a number of questions about this system. “Yes, they have acknowledged they are not ready. Yes, they are not indicating that a year down the line they will launch the points demerit system. But we do not believe that the demerit system can be put in place while we have such poor administration with the e-Natis system and challenge with the Post Office and other administrative burdens related to this matter,” says Duvenage. AUDIO: OUTA’s Wayne Duvenage says there are still a number of questions about this system: Mbalula says this is aimed at addressing lawlessness on the road and to ensure motorists adhere to road safety rules. “The adjudication process will be set in motion to assist traffic infringers, without burdening courts of law. If not in agreement, as a recourse, this will reduce the burden on the courts,” says Mbalula. AUDIO: Mbalula says the system is aimed at addressing lawlessness:  A public awareness campaign will be conducted from now to educate road users about the system. He says there will be an appeals process for motorists who want to challenge the infringements served.
