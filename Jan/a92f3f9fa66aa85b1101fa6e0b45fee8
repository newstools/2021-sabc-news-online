Economist Duma Gqubule says South Africa cannot afford a more stringent lockdown, following speculation on social media that the country will be moved to harder lockdown this week. Many social media users are convinced that alert level five lockdown is just around the corner amid a spike in COVID-19 infections during the festive season. South Africa recorded 12 601 COVID-19 cases in 24 hours bringing the cumulative number to over 1.1 million cases. Another 434 people succumbed to COVID-19 related complications. Gqubule says a stringent lockdown can only delay the surge in new coronavirus infections and has this advice for the government for it to win the fight against the pandemic. He says, “We have to have a proper public health response. We have to have test results coming out very quickly like in a few hours. And we have a chaotic public sector testing system where results took two days, so we can’t use a lockdown as a substitute for not having proper public health measures. That’s what I’m trying to say, a lockdown is what happens when everything else has failed.” COVID-19 STATISTICS IN SOUTH AFRICA sabcnews.com |  SABC News Channel | SABC Radio news SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 217 432 174 176 28 333 39 045 UNALLOCATED 0 AS AT 04 JANUARY 2021 7716 622 656 DEATHS 2189 7352 5763 4713 602 CONFIRMED CASES| 1 113 349 DEATHS | 30 011 TESTS CONDUCTED | 6 780 272 RECOVERIES | 911 573 398 86163 301 212 41 735 26 019 221 657  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 63 740 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); COVID-19 pandemic dominated headlines across the globe in 2020 and will undoubtedly continue to do so this year: The COVID-19 pandemic dominated headlines across the globe in 2020 and will undoubtedly continue to do so in 2021.
