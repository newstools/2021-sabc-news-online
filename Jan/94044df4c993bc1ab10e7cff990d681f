The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) says it has put in place measures to ensure that the current labour action does not affect operations at the public broadcaster. Unions at the SABC have threatened a four-hour blackout before midday on Friday as part of a protest against the retrenchments of over 300 permanent staff. Two days ago, striking workers gathered at the public broadcaster’s Auckland Park headquarters in Johannesburg before proceeding to the Union Buildings in Pretoria in a motorcade to hand a memorandum to the Presidency. They are demanding an end to planned retrenchments and the dissolution of the SABC Board. On Thursday, the workers embarked on a go-slow. SABC Chief Operations Officer, Ian Plaatjies says, “About the go-slow as well, there’s been no impact on business. In terms of a threat of a blackout, firstly we’re an essential service, so I don’t know how they can threaten a blackout, but be that as it may, we have mitigating ways for that as well, to prevent that from happening, so we’ll be implementing that.” Constitutional issues SABC News Economics Editor Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki says they are not only striking about labour issues, but also on constitutional issues: In the video below, Gqubule-Mbeki says the way the process was done was inhumane and cruel:
