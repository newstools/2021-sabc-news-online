People must know why it needs to be done and why it is good for them and based on that they must take a positive decision on the basis of the fact that they, as responsible citizens, would like to participate in goodwill.” Mkhize has sought to allay fears over the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine and has urged the public to be wary of bogus social media posts that discourage the use of the jab. “There are people who are very concerned about the vaccine.
