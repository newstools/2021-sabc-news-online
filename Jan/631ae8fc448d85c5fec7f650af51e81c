Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi has appealed to government for relief for what he says are overburdened officials. He says due to the increasing number of COVID-19 deaths, many people are frequenting his department’s offices to seek death certificates for their loved ones. Motsoaledi says this is placing a strain on the department’s employees. Addressing the media in Pretoria on Tuesday, Motsoaledi said they were proposing that the issuing of birth and death certificates take place at the relevant hospitals. “We are proposing that all birth and death certificates be registered at the health facility where they took place. You are aware that people die in hospitals … [their] relatives and funeral parlours come to Home Affairs to collect the death certificates. We are asking that those certificates be collected at the hospital where the death took place,” says the Minister.
