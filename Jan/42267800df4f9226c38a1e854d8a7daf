Police Spokesperson Athlenda Mathe says: “At the time of the arrest we were acting on the information provided by the security officials at the airport after a security scanner identified irregular images as the trio arrived in South Africa. Upon questioning of the suspect and inspection of the hand luggage, officials discovered the gold bars weighing 73. 5 kg and some foreign currency.” “Investigations are also underway by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) with the assistance of Interpol with authorities from various countries to determine the legitimacy of the certification papers as provided by the men and also to determine the country of origin where the gold was mined. Investigations will also focus on which country the gold bars were destined for,” adds Mathe.
