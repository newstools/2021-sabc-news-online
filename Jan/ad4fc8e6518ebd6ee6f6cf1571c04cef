A 29-year-old man has been arrested in Brixton in Johannesburg in connection with the killing of a 20-year-old woman and her nine-month-old daughter last week. Chantel Ash and Tasneem were killed at a lodge in Mokopane in Limpopo last week. Police say they had checked in at the lodge with a man but he had disappeared. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe says Chantel and Tasneem were found strangled and hands tied behind their backs. Moatshe says the suspect will appear in court on Friday. “Provincial Commissioner LG Nneke Ledwaba has welcomed the arrest of a 29-year-old suspect yesterday (Thursday) in connection with the alleged murder of his 20-year-old partner and their nine-month-old girl at a lodge between Mokopane and Marken near Maswodi village on the 14 of January 2021. ” “The motive of the killing is not known but domestic violence cannot be ruled out. The suspect is expected to appear before the Mokerong Magistrate’s Court today (Friday),” says Moatshe.
