Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says those who will be allowed to use South Africa’s borders include learners who attend schools in the country and live in their countries of origin but have clear documentation. He says those who work in the health and cargo transportation sectors will also be allowed to pass through. South Africans who want to come back home will be allowed to do so and those who want to go back to their respective countries will also be given the right of passage. The borders have been closed – except for a few exceptions. President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address:  Briefing the media following President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address to the nation, Motsoaledi reiterated that strict protocols would be imposed at all 20 land borders in the country, during the adjusted Alert Level three of the lockdown. “If people don’t fall into any of the categories that I have mentioned but believe their case is strong enough, they will then apply to the Minister of Home Affairs for exemption. But [applicants] will have to have a copy of the passport, a copy of temporary residence visa and proper documents for requesting to enter the Republic for a number of the intended days of stay. Proof of accommodation or residence when they are inside the country [is required],” explains Motsoaledi.
