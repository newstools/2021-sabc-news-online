Outgoing African Union (AU) chairperson, Cyril Ramaphosa, has condemned human rights violations in Africa. He says the AU wants to see democracy take root on the continent. The South African President adds that his administration deplores any form of the trampling of human rights, including freedom of speech and right of movement, which are the cornerstone of the country’s democracy. “When it comes to the AU, obviously we want to see democracy setting its root on the continent. Human rights are important and are a very important aspect of our International Relations policy. We deplore any form of the trampling of human rights; be it press freedom, freedom of movement, freedom of speech. We deplore that and condemn it in the strongest terms wherever it happens on our continent. That’s what South Africa stands for.” Zanu-PF allegations Ramaphosa also weighed in on Zanu-PF spokesperson Tafadzwa Mugwadi’s threat to leak a bombshell about the motivation behind the governing ANC’s visit to Zimbabwe during South Africa’s hard lockdown. The ANC president says as far he was concerned – the ANC delegation went there for a meeting with the organisation’s ally. However, he says, he hopes Mugwadi would be willing to expand on his assertions. “I am sure that he (Mugwadi) will be willing to share that with the ANC and with all of us. We sent a delegation as the African National Congress, to Zimbabwe because Zanu-PF is a sister party to us; we have deep and strong links with Zanu-PF. It was one to express concern and find out what’s happening, to see the extent to which we can be supportive and also fully understand precisely what is happening. As far as we concerned, there is nothing amidst there is noting that we could say we to hide in as far as sending that delegation.” Ibbo Mandaza says President Emmerson Mnangagwa must put Mugwadi in line for his claims about the ANC trip to Zimbabwe:
