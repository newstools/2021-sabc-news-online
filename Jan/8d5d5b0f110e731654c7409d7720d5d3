The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Parliament says Small Business Development Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni has only authorised the use of 8% of the COVID-19 relief funds for small businesses. Government had initially budgeted R1.4 billion for qualifying Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises affected by the pandemic. In the video below, is a discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on small businesses:  DA spokesperson on Small Business Development in Parliament, Jan de Villiers, says he has written to the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee to urgently call Ntshavheni to account before them. “The Minister must urgently appear to report to Parliament and explain why her department has failed to allocate 92% of the funds that are meant as COVID-19 relief funds. As the government continues to enforce extended lockdown regulations, the small businesses and the breadwinners will continue to suffer. Especially on our coastal towns where beach closures have dealt a heavy blow to our coastal business owners,” says De Villiers.
