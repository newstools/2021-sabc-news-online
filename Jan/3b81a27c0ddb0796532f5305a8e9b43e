Three suspects arrested at the OR Tambo International Airport after being found with gold in their luggage will be back in the Kempton Park Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday next week. They made a brief appearance in court in the east of Johannesburg on Monday. The suspects were arrested at the weekend for dealing in precious metal and contravening the Customs Act after flying into South Africa from Madagascar through Dubai. The 73.5 kg of gold has an estimated value of R61-million. Police Spokesperson Athlenda Mathe says: “There is a possibility that money laundering and fraud charges will be brought forward against the three accused at a later stage. The matter has been postponed to the 12th of January 2020 for further investigation and formal bail application. While investigations continue, the Hawks through Interpol is in talks with authorities in Madagascar, Dubai and Ethiopia to establish where this gold originates from and where it was destined to.”
