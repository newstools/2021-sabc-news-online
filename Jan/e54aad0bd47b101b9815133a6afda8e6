New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says his state has found its first case of the more contagious, “UK”strain of the coronavirus, raising concerns about threats to hospital capacity should it spread rapidly in the state. Cuomo says on Monday that a man in his 60s living in a town north of Albany has the new strain. The man, who is recovering, had not traveled recently, suggesting community spread is taking place. New York has carried out 5 000 tests for the new strain -and so far has only found the one case. Cuomo says it could be a”game changer” if the new strain increases hospitalisations and forces regions to close down.
