United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the coronavirus pandemic can only be defeated with global solidarity and he’s called on richer nations to provide any surplus doses of the vaccines to poorer nations. The global COVID-19-related death toll has breached the 2 million mark, with over 93.7 million infections recorded since the pandemic began in late December 2019. Nearly 67 million recoveries have been registered. Many countries are now battling new variants of the virus which seem to be more infectious, but which scientists say do not cause more severe illness. Guterres says vaccine manufacturers must work with the World Health Organisation (WHO) COVAX facility to ensure equal distribution. “Some countries are procuring side deals even procuring beyond needs. Governments have a responsibility to protect their populations but vaccine nationalism is self-defeating and will delay a global recovery.
