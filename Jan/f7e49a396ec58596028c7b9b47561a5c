Family members, friends and the Mahikeng community at large are devastated following the death of Mmamotale Gladys Montshioa, the wife of the late Kgosi Setumo Stephen Montshioa of Barolong Bo Rra Tshidi clan. Mmamotale Montshioa died on Friday. She was from the Royal family of Moshoete in Ga-Khunwana. Montshioa passed on due to COVID-related complications. Family spokesperson Pastor Piet Tlhabanyane says funeral arrangements are under way. “All the mourners who will not be able to come to the funeral service as a result of COVID-19 pandemic regulations the family is arranging that they form a guard of honour along the way to the grave side. Hope we will be able to find closure with this woman who became a blessing to the majority of us.” Kgosi White Modisenyane of the Barolong Boo-Nthua in Mahikeng says she was a true mother to all of them. “It was a shock to us not only on my side to the whole entire nation of Borolong. We didn’t even realise that one day she will be missed in our society.” Mmamotale Gladys Montshioa is survived by four children. Her husband Kgosi Setumo Stephen Montshioa passed 21 years ago.
