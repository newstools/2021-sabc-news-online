Minister of Home Affairs, Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi, has arrived at the Beitbridge Border Post in Musina, Limpopo, to assess the situation and monitor compliance. Motsoaledi is scheduled to be at the border for the rest of the weekend in a mission to resolve problems relating to delays in processing documents, traffic congestion, and alleged false COVID-19 certificates by travellers who are crossing to South Africa from various countries mainly Zimbabwe.  Meanwhile, one of the truck drivers who is crossing the border says he is pleased with the improvement of services at the Musina Border Post. “At the moment I’m going to DRC, I’m coming from Durban where I loaded. It seems now the traffic has improved other than last week when I was coming from Congo I spent 10 days here at the border but now it seems it has been improved. “We don’t know whether the situation is about testing COVID or is about the system at the border. We still have to know, my advice is maybe if they can put more traffic cops to monitor the movement of trucks.”
