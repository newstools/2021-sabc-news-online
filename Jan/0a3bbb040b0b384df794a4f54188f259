CEO at the Charlotte Maxeke Hospital Gladys Bogoshi says the alcohol ban has had an impact on the amount of patients received at the hospital. Speaking during Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize’s visit to the hospital, Bogoshi says the hospital currently has 183 COVID-19 patients with many of them in need of oxygen supply. Gauteng has seen an increase in cases as residents return from their holiday destinations. Bogoshi says the alcohol ban has alleviated a burden for staff at the hospital. “People who are drunk abuse our health workers. We actually have police vans standing in casualty just so that they can protect the staff. Many a times, I have to be with the Brigadier from Hillbrow, because when they fight outside, they want to finish each other in casualty. So the trauma that our health workers get with alcohol is not okay,” says Bogoshi.
