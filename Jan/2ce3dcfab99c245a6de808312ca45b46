The North West Local Government Department has placed the Ratlou Local Municipality under administration. It says this is because of the poor delivery of basic services and maladministration in the municipality which is based in Setlagole near Mahikeng. The municipality joins four others that are currently under administration namely Madibeng, Ramotshere Moiloa, Tswaing and JB Marks. MEC Mmoloki Cwaile says previous interventions in the municipality were unsuccessful. “Despite service delivery challenges, we do not have senior managers in the municipality. We do not have any of its critical projects implemented. We do not have any expenditure and really we had to agree that previously, the intervention did not necessarily achieve what it wanted to.” “So, we have introduced the administrator and we expect that the administrator should assume responsibility immediately,” says Cwaile.
