Police Minister Bheki Cele says more than 20 000 people have been arrested for contravening the Disaster Management Act since the start of the adjusted alert level 3 lockdown last month. The country remains on the adjusted Alert level as COVID-19 infection rates increase rapidly. Police Ministry spokesperson Lirandzu Themba says about 7 455 people were arrested for not wearing masks in public places. Themba says, “These arrests were made despite people being told continuously to wear their masks. Wearing a mask is mandatory and people caught without one in public are committing an offence. The wearing of masks is both for your safety and the safety of others around you.” “Minister Cele has commended the majority of South Africans who are complying with the adjusted regulations. I want to stress the point that the law enforcement agencies do not enjoy making these arrests as these laws are there to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus that’s ravaging our country,” added Themba.
