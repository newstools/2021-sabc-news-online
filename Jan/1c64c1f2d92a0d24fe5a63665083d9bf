South African National Editors Forum (SANEF) has hailed late Minister in the Presidency, Jackson Mthembu, as an advocate for media freedom. SANEF Chairperson Sbu Ngalwa was speaking at a virtual memorial service hosted by the African National Congress (ANC) in honour of Mthembu on Monday. Mthembu passed away last Thursday from COVID-19 related complications and was buried on Sunday at the Old Pretoria Road Cemetery in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga. Ngalwa says Mthembu believed that for it to survive, the ANC needed to be held accountable. “We know that he was an advocate for media freedom, he believed that for its own survival, the ANC needs to be held accountable and held to scrutiny the closure of some publications is contributing to the poorer content that is being produced.” Virtual memorial service hosted by the ANC in honour of Mthembu: Role model In another virtual memorial service hosted by the Government Communication and Information System on Monday, Deputy President David Mabuza said Mthembu was a role model to his colleagues.
