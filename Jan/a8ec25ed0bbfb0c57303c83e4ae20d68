The family of the late Presiding Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Southern Africa, Molwane Ubane, says his death has come as a shock. Bishop Ubane is reported to have died from COVID-19 related complications. 59-year-old Ubane was elected the Presiding Bishop in 2017. His family says besides being a Bishop, he had a love for his family and relatives. Family spokesperson, Ethel Masilo, says they will remember him as a unifier. “He was a brother to others and a grandfather. The love that he has given to us, the unity that he was preaching. We will always remember him that he was a pillar of strength. He was actually everything to us.” His Deputy Dean, Kedibone Molete says Ubane had a vision for his church. “Bishop Ubane was an open man, a loving man who was open to advise. A father to everybody, to young people in the church. We have lost indeed and we were still enjoying him and we have so many hopes.” Last year September, Bishop Molwane Ubane took part in a protest march aimed at fighting corruption of Personal Protecting Equipment and Gender-Based Violence in Mahikeng. During that march, the late Presiding Bishop said, “As the church, we cannot keep quiet when we see our people suffering and people are busy looting in the coffers of our country. We are not going to allow that and that is why we are here as the church been the voice of the poor. We are here to say enough is enough and corruption will not be our heritage and we will never allow that.” Bishop Ubane’s memorial service will be held on Monday and his funeral on Friday in Tlhabane Rustenburg.
