This comes as many holidaymakers return to the province after their summer holiday getaways. RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane says, “Traffic volumes are expected to increase in Gauteng as holidaymakers return from their holidays. Motorists are urged to put their lights on as it is overcast in many parts of the country. Already traffic in KwaZulu-Natal is building up with 1600 vehicles recorded in Mooi River. More traffic volumes are expected on the N1 from Limpopo and on the N4 from Mpumalanga. It is encouraging to note that many motorists have left early. Many vehicles are already reaching Gauteng.”
