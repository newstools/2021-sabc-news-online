The race for the Democratic Alliance’s (DA) KZN provincial leader is expected to be a tough battle as three well-known party leaders have been tipped to contest the position. DA Chief Whip in the provincial legislature, Francois Rogers, eThekwini caucus leader, Nicole Graham and her Deputy Emmanuel Mhlongo are expected to contest the position. The conference is scheduled for the end of March. Outgoing Provincial leader Zwakele Mncwango says they are yet to decide whether the conference will be held virtually. Mncwango maintains that he will not avail himself for re-election. “We are ready for the conference in KwaZulu-Natal. The conference will take place on the 27th March and the progress is going very well. We are anticipating that, obviously, by that time we will be out of lockdown. In any way, we are ready even if there is still a lockdown, we are prepared to use virtual means and having this conference. In terms of the nominations process, it will be opened at the right time, and we have call timeline. I think it is around towards the end of February where we will open nominations,” says Mncwango.
