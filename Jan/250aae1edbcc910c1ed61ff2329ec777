Some Zimbabwean nationals plying their trade in South Africa say they have decided to come back on New Year’s after rumours started circulating in Zimbabwe that the Beitbridge Border post might be closed on Sunday. A number of buses carrying passengers have been crossing the border into the country. At a stop and search roadblock point in Musina, some of them were found to be undocumented and were deported back to their countries. They did not possess passports and COVID-19 certificates. One of the Zimbabwean nationals says the rumours of a looming border closure caused him panic and he decided to take an early trip. “South African side are processing papers very quickly there’s no delay there in South African side the Zimbabwean side as well is only the traffic jam the cars are too much in Zimbabwean side there’s a rumour, which is circulating that maybe on 3rd of January the border is going to be closed. I thought is better for me to go the earlier. We are afraid to stay in Zimbabwe the border might be closed while still in Zimbabwe.” Minister of Home Affairs, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, is expected to visit the Beitbridge border post to assess the situation.
