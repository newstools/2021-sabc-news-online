Humanitarian organisation Gift of the Givers will on Monday officially open a newly renovated doctors’ accommodation at the Bhisho hospital near King William’s Town in the Eastern Cape. This after it became evident that the facility is losing out on interns, community service doctors and senior medical personnel owing to the absence of suitable accommodation at the hospital. Amongst other things, the organisation has donated 120 beds dedicated specifically to COVID-19 as well as mattresses, linen and high flow oxygen machines. Gift of the Givers founder Imtiaz Sooliman says the initiative was triggered by the realisation that there was a shortage of doctors living closer to the hospital. “With the patient numbers rising during the second wave, medical personnel were critical to serve those patients. Doctors being allocated to Bisho hospital had no proper residence and there was a shortage of decent accommodation. It is then that we decided to renovate this building at a cost of three million. The building team worked through Christmas and new year to have this building ready on time for the medical personnel to move in in January. A second building on site is being looked at to increase accommodation capacity for more doctors to come to Bhisho hospital.” In the video below, the orgnisation donated equipment ranging from hospital beds, oxygen machines and personal protective equipment to the Bhisho hospital earlier this month:  Meanwhile, South Africa has recorded 12 267 new coronavirus cases and 254 deaths in the last 24 hours.
