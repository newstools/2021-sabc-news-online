The Tshegofatso Pule murder trial in the Johannesburg High Court has again been postponed to February 19. The accused, 31-year-old Muzikayise Malephane’s legal team told the court they’ve had issues consulting their client on the premeditated murder charge he faces. The 28-year-old Pule was pregnant when she was found hanging from a tree with multiple stab wounds in Durban Deep, on Gauteng’s west rand. Pule’s uncle, Tumisang Katake, says the family is disappointed that the case has yet again been postponed. “Some things you don’t look forward to them. I would’ve thought that today the trial was going to resume but unfortunately, I don’t know what is that the defence is delaying about is. I wasn’t privy to the discussions that they had with the judge.” “We’re devastated. You could hear even from the screams from the gallery from the family members when they were indicating the postponement to the 19th of February. I don’t think everyone is satisfied, including myself.” In October, the case against the man accused of killing 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule was postponed to the 19th of November at the High Court in Johannesburg.  In June, Pule was last seen leaving her boyfriend’s home. Malephane was arrested a few days after Pule’s body was found while he was allegedly travelling back to Gauteng from Mpumalanga. Legislation to fight gender-based violence Pule’s murder in June sent shockwaves throughout the country amid the scourge of Gender-Based Violence (GBV). In September, President Cyril Ramaphosa introduced three key Bills aimed at fighting the GBV.
