Eight people have been killed in a three-vehicle pile-up on the N1 near Leeu Gamka in the Karoo. Western Cape Traffic spokesperson Jandre Bakker says two minibus-taxis and a heavy motor vehicle collided shortly after midnight near Rietfontein. He says traffic has been disrupted because the scene of the crash is still being cleared. “Preliminary reports suggest that the heavy motor vehicle was travelling in the direction of Cape Town, and the minibus-taxis toward the Eastern Cape. The driver of the truck was seriously injured, the single occupant, the driver of the one taxi was fatally injured, while in the other taxi six passengers and the driver died, bringing the death toll to eight. The cause of the crash is being investigated. A stop-and-go is in place, but the road may be closed for short periods when the scene is cleared.”
