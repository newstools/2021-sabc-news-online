Speaker of the North West Legislature Susan Dantjie says the late former Public Works MEC Mmule Maluleka served the provincial government with distinction. Maluleka died on Friday at her house in Mathibestad village in Moretele after a long illness.

Later after serving as a MEC of Public Works, she was deployed back to the legislature where she was then appointed as the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Public Works and served until the end of term in 2019. Maluleka was then deployed into the Office of the Speaker of the North West provincial legislature.
