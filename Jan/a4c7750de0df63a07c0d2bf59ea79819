Young Nurses Indaba Trade Union (YNITU) is calling for the boycott of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine as it is not yet clear what it does to the body. President of the YNITU, Lerato Mthunzi, says she won’t be taking the vaccine. “A lot of people are saying they won’t be forced to take the vaccine in fact we will have to boycott this particular vaccine. It makes sense because you have not even told us what we must be vaccinated against and also you are not telling us what we must inform the communities.” Health  Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has said healthcare workers will be prioritised when South Africa gets the vaccines. A first batch of doses is due this month from India. Minister Mkhize briefs the Portfolio Committee on status of healthcare services:  However, Mthunzi says South Africans must first be properly educated about the vaccine. “You need to tell people about the pros and cons. People cannot just be vaccinated, people must be educated and that’s what we advocate for.” The union also says it is worried that government is failing to hire more health workers despite the growing number of infections. They are also complaining that nurses are overworked, underpaid and afraid for their lives because they are allegedly still expected to work without Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) in some instances.
