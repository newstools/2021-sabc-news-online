Police are investigating a case of public violence after shops were set alight in the Durban CBD. Police Spokesperson Jay Naicker says a group of about 30 people gathered at King Dinuzulu Park, indicating that they wanted to march to the City Hall to hand over a memorandum. He says they were informed that they would not be allowed to march. Naicker says at the same time another group of  people set alight shops in the CBD. Naicker says one person has been arrested after he tried to stab a police officer and will be charged with attempted murder. “Whilst this was happening, another group converged in the city and began looting shops. Reports were received of two shops as well as a stall belonging to a street vendor that were set alight. Police officers from Durban Central and Metro Police responded. They pursued the group and one suspect was arrested. He attempted to stab police officers during the arrest, but was quickly subdued without any injury to any of the arresting officers. Some stolen items were recovered from the arrested suspects.”
