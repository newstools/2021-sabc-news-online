Tributes continue to pour in for Director of the Anti-Drug Forum SA at Chatsworth south of Durban Sam Pillay, who passed away due to COVID-19-related complications this morning. His passing follows the death of his wife, Indrani, over the weekend. The couple’s funerals will start at 8 o’clock tomorrow morning at their family home in Chatsworth, before proceeding to the Clare Estate Crematorium. Sixty-four-year-old Pillay was a champion in the fight against drug abuse, with Smart Clubs at schools in KwaZulu-Natal, Mauritius, and the African continent. Pillay was also very involved in the Chatsworth Community Policing Forum and Parents’ Association of KwaZulu-Natal. A friend and fellow activist, Manick Gibson, says they planned to open a rehabilitation facility in the Durban area, a plan that will go ahead in his memory. “He was a victim of substance abuse in the family, and that inspired him. He himself was not an addict, but it inspired him to take care of, especially, the children who succumbed to the disease of addiction. As you know, he took on the drug dealers. He was in fact, this year, nominated for the executive committee of the central drug authority. He was also the deputy chair of the KZN provincial forum. He’s even spoken in Kenya, Mauritius. His attitude and the work that he’s done in the substance abuse field transcends the South African community; he’s internationally known.” Below are the latest coronavirus statistics:  SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 302 582 190 402 54 362 60 355 UNALLOCATED 0 10 072 1 ﻿023 873 DEATHS 2 625 9 844 7 642 7 372 877 546 86163 380 381 54 724 30 960 265 428  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 73 792 24 JANUARY 2021 1 412 986 40 874 7 993 126 1 230 520 8 ﻿147 300 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
