African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa says the party’s National Executive Committee along with its alliance partners have agreed on a massive social mobilisation campaign to help roll out the coronavirus vaccine across the country. The ANC president was delivering the closing address at the party’s Virtual NEC Lekgotla on Sunday evening. Ramaphosa says South Africa also needs to invest in its own vaccination programme and improve preparedness for the future crisis. “We need to build broad acceptance amongst our people of the vaccine programme and to vigorously tackle misinformation and misunderstanding. Our planning and preparedness for the future crisis must be improved, this must include investment in our own vaccine development and production capacity. And this is when we need to have African solutions for African problems.” Closing Address by President Cyril Ramaphosa – #ANCNEC Lekgotla https://t.co/3yHcPjaYBd — African National Congress #ANC109 (@MYANC) January 24, 2021  The three-day meeting was attended by the party’s former presidents Thabo Mbeki, Jacob Zuma and deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe.
