Health Ombudsman Professor Malegapuru Makgoba says he has requested a forensic audit into the Tembisa Tertiary Hospital in Ekurhuleni, which will look at issues such as corporative governance, the relationship between nursing staff and doctors as well as the processes of the hospital when dealing with patients. This follows findings of gross negligence relating to the care and death of businessman Shonisani Lethole at the hospital. Makgoba has recommended that the Gauteng Department of Health take disciplinary action against 19 staff members, including nurses and medical doctors at the hospital. The #HealthOmbud findings on the #ShonisaniLethole death are shocking. The report makes a strong case for us to reflect on the #Ubuntu deficit among us, including some of our health professionals. We need a #kindness–#Ubuntu revolution and reset for all our sakes. #SocialJustice https://t.co/1QnXMZB3Dg — Prof Thuli Madonsela (@ThuliMadonsela3) January 27, 2021  Makgoba says the doctors’ records of Lethole’s care were missing. “The doctor’s records of the 23, 24, 25, 28, 29 and 30th … all those records are missing and I was not alerted that they are not there and they are not the only documents missing I couldn’t find an adequate explanation for why they are not there. I have requested a forensic audit firm to go and look at certain aspects one of them is corporate governance the systems and policies and processes of admission a fitness for purpose kind of assessment of the leadership and management of the hospital,” says Makgoba.
