A family from Lusikisiki in the Eastern Cape is furious after burying the wrong body. A funeral parlour informed the family after the burial that there was a mix-up. During the coronavirus pandemic, there have been numerous incidents in which bodies have been mixed up. The family’s spokesperson, Manono Sombile, says they are devastated. “We were surprised, Friday, yesterday, just after 16:00 we received a call from the branch of the parlour advising us that actually the body that we buried is actually not of our sister, as a result, they want to exhume the body but there is a further process. They need to go to court and get the authorization so we feel that the parlour has taken us for granted, the service of our sister was not given the dignity it deserves and we are disappointed, we are angry and we are furious about this,” says Sombile.
