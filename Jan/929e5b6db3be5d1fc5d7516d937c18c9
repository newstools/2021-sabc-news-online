A planned ceremony for 25 initiates in Kubusi village in Qumbu in the Eastern Cape has ended up with the police being deployed as COVID-19 protocols were not adhered to. Traditional Affairs MEC Xolile Nqatha also cancelled his plan to attend the ceremony. Under Alert Level 3 of the COVID 19 regulations, families are prohibited from hosting traditional homecoming festivities known as imigidi. The locals also interfered with those who were reporting on the event. One of the locals Patrick Mdomba says they will not take instructions from the police. “Police say they will not leave if these journalists are still here, they say our initiates will not come back home if the reporters do not leave, where do they get that, as the Tshabalalas we do not take instructions from anyone. We will do things according to our will.” Nqatha says he believes his officials were misled. “I discovered that they did not comply with the regulations as a result I decided not to go there and we have since requested SAPS to disperse the gathering and investigate if anything can be done for those who are responsible for breaking the regulations.” Homecoming ceremony for 25 initiates:
