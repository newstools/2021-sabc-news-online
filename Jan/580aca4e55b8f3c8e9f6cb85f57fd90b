A case of sexual assault has been opened against a senior official at the Northern Cape Department of Education in Kimberley. This after reports that a woman had come forward with allegations that for years, the senior official had groped her, made salacious comments towards her and offered her a comfortable life and career progression in the department in exchange for sex. The woman, who cannot be named to protect her identity, says she was subjected to relentless sexual harassment by the senior official for about two years. She says on one of the more harrowing occasions, the man allegedly followed her into the women’s toilet at the department’s head office and attempted to undress her. Another department senior official is facing similar allegations but is not under any criminal investigation. Both of the men remain on duty. Department Spokesperson Lehuma Ntuane says the department is looking into the conduct of both the officials. “We are busy with an investigation into this matter. By next week Friday, we will make our decision known, whether we suspend the officials or we do not. This matter is a matter that is under investigation. Therefore, we would not want to comment any further out of fear of compromising the investigation,” says Ntuane. Two Northern Cape Education officials accused of sexual harassment  Northern Cape Police Spokesperson Brigadier Mohale Ramatseba confirmed that a case was opened against the one official. “A case has been opened and it is being investigated by members of the family violence, child protection and sexual offenses unit and the case is being processed at the present moment,” says Ramatseba. Police say once the investigation against the official is finalised, it will be referred to National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for a decision on whether or not to prosecute.
