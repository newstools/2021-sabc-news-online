Gauteng law enforcement authorities have warned those who continue to violate Level 3 Lockdown regulations that they will be dealt with harshly. Authorities say many taverns and shebeens continue to transport and sell alcohol illegally. Members of the Joburg Metro Police Department were called in this week to disperse a crowd of youths in Dobsonville in Soweto who were attending an after tears event where alcohol was being consumed. Some of them were arrested. Many people are still not wearing masks when out in public. The Gauteng Community Safety Department says such activities are in violation of regulations and transgressors will face the full might of the law. Transporting alcohol & having it in your vehicle is not permitted. Motorists and passengers arrested.
