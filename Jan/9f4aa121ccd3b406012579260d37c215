Traffic volumes at Maseru Bridge on South Africa’s border with Lesotho have started to increase significantly. It seems many traveLlers are opting for an early return to South Africa to avoid congestion. South African Home Affairs Director, Tommy Makhode, has been spending time at Maseru Bridge to ensure smooth processing and adherence to COVID-19 regulations. “There were capacity delays on the side of the border. We have now beefed up the capacity. We have now opened up where one of our houses is to accommodate NLH staff to assist in terms of the travellers that are coming through to SA. We have also brought tourist monitors to ensure they prioritise women, the elderly and those that are vulnerable. But crucial is also to ensure that the borderline has patrolling so that we make sure those who do not have documentation cannot enter into the Republic.”  Beitbridge Border Post Meanwhile, Home Affairs Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi arrived at the Beitbridge Border Post in Musina, Limpopo, yesterday to assess the situation. He is there until today. The Minister warned against immigrants who present bogus coronavirus certificates. The Minister says they must be deported back to their countries of origin instead of giving them a test in South Africa. Motsoaledi says South Africa cannot accept people who submit fraudulent documents into the country.
