The spokesperson of the Bapedi Royal Kingdom, Ntoampe Mampuru, says the family has a succession plan as to who should succeed late King Thulare Victor Thulare the Third. The King died of COVID-19-related complications and is being buried at the family cemetery at Mohlaletsi in the Sekhukhune district in Limpopo. President Cyril Ramaphosa is amongst the mourners. Mampuru dismissed allegations that there will be kingship dispute squabbles. “There are speculations that after the burial there might be some succession disputes and so I want to state it clear to the people that according to our customs and tradition there are rules and regulations that must be followed and the royalty I don’t think there will any fight because we know each other, we know the children of the late King Rhyne Sekhukhune the third, those are the people of the royal family and we shall decide what should happen.”
