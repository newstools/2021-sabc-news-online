Political analyst Lukhona Mnguni says members of the public should prepare themselves for explosive evidence which an unidentified witness has started to give at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg. The evidence which relates to the State Security Agency comes after the agency’s Director-General Loyiso Jafta appeared before the commission on Tuesday. He confirmed the testimony of former Chairperson of the High Level Panel of Review into the agency Sydney Mufamadi, that the agency allegedly conducted illegal operations and siphoned huge sums of money from the organisation often for fictitious projects. Mnguni says Wednesday’s evidence will definitely be interesting. “Well I mean the fact that the identity of the witness is concealed, it means that there is some form of insider or whistleblower within SSA. Definitely we should expect some more damning evidence, if not strengthening evidence to what we have already seen. Without a doubt, we are all waiting anxiously to find out exactly what part of the evidence that particular witness is going to hand out,” explains Mnguni. Below is the live stream of today’s proceedings:  Meanwhile on Tuesday, acting State Security Agency Director General, Loyiso Jafta, said the SSA has suffered from selective adherence to the law, employees being given illegal instructions as well as corruption and theft. Jafta, who was testifying at the State Capture Commission, was appointed in 2018. He confirmed the use of the SSA for political as well as factional struggles within the ANC.
