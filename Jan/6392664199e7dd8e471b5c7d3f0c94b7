Community members of Gugulethu on the Cape Flats are rallying around a family whose four-year-old child was mauled to death by two Pitbulls at the weekend. Milani Keke was playing with his ball when it fell into his neighbour’s yard. The dogs allegedly attacked him when he went to retrieve it. His mother is currently being treated in hospital for shock and trauma. The animals have been removed by the SPCA. Gugulethu Development Forum General Secretary, Vincent Domingo, says they’re supporting the child’s family. “These Pitbull dogs are very dangerous so it’s for owners to be liable when things like this happen. Secondly, the children were playing and the problem that we have in Gugulethu is that we do not have enough facilities for young people to play like playgrounds and things like that.” During Pitbull awareness month in October, a deaf and mute boy from Hanover Park on the Cape Flats died in hospital after being mauled by a Pitbull. It is believed Luqmaan Jardien was playing in the backyard of his home when the incident occurred. Pitbull rescuer Marizanne Ferreira said incompetent owners are the reason the breed has a bad reputation. “In my opinion and I say this with respect, the reason for the bad reputation in the media, is incompetent owners and people who use them for the wrong reasons. Pit bulls love people. They thrive on human contact, on human affirmation and they will do anything to please their owner.” Discussion on whether Pitbull dogs should be banned in South Africa:
