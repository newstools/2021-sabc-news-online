He says the main area of concern is Gauteng where people will come back to work which could bring a resurgence of the virus. “I will be moving up to a few other provinces. I will be visiting Limpopo and Gauteng because that’s really where we see the numbers have gone up. If you look at Limpopo, the numbers there are more than what they were in the previous peak in June. If you look at Gauteng, the peak is almost the same as what it was in June. We were just worried about the fact that moving from the holidays people are going to be moving up to Gauteng and that’s going to give us huge amounts of a resurgence in that particular part of the country.” Minister Mkhize meets scientists to discuss the new COVID-19 variant:  Meanwhile, Chairperson of the COVID-19 Ministerial Advisory Committee, Professor Salim Abdool Karim, says there is evidence that the new variant of the coronavirus in South Africa, known as 501Y.V2, is 50% more infectious as it binds more readily to human cells. However, there is no evidence that it causes a more severe COVID-19 infection. Professor Karim was part of a panel hosted by Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on the latest regarding the new COVID-19 variant.
