Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says there are currently enough beds to deal with increasing numbers of coronavirus cases in the province. Winde and Provincial Health Minister, Nomafrench Mbombo have conducted an oversight visit at Stellenbosch Hospital. The latest figures show a total of 8 182 deaths in the province from COVID-19 and 3 162 new positive cases. Winde says there is no need to build additional field hospitals at this stage. “There are extra beds in Vredendal; there are extra beds in George; there are extra beds in Hermanus; and even if you look at Mitchell’s Plain, you look at their physio ward, the only real field hospital is the Hospital of Hope on the R300 because at some stage that is going to have to be decommissioned and every extra bed that’s being put in place it’s a bed that’s going to be used in health.” [WATCH] I'm at Stellenbosch hospital to see the innovative work they have done to prepare the system for Covid-19  pic.twitter.com/1Q94Qd8azN — Premier Alan Winde (@alanwinde) January 11, 2021  Winde says he is worried about the increasing number of cases on the West Coast of the province. “Please, people on the West Coast, let’s keep flattening the curve.” He says the province has reached its peak of the second wave. “We have all got to continue what we are doing. It also shows in the numbers, we have reached nearly 3 500 beds, in both the private and public sectors. Oxygen, we normally use 12 tons a day, in the first peak we used 27 tons a day, now we are using nearly 70 tons a day.” He has thanked frontline workers who are under pressure. “Our medical frontline workers have been absolute stars, and then of course, the other frontline workers from law enforcement, municipal services across the province, and the citizens, thank you very much.” Here’s a look at my week ahead  pic.twitter.com/xU7doh8dlU — Premier Alan Winde (@alanwinde) January 11, 2021
