President Cyril Ramaphosa has joined others in paying tribute to the late Sibongile Khumalo describing her as an unmistakable voice on concert stages around the country and the world. He says the world-renowned opera singer and jazz maestro was also a voice of advocacy for the performing arts, for the rights and place of women in society and for human rights at large. The 63-year-old Khumalo who was awarded the National Order of Ikhamanga died on Thursday of stroke-related complications. Ramaphosa who remembered her landmark performances at the former president Nelson Mandela’s 75th birthday and 1994 inauguration amongst others, says she will be sadly missed. Presidential spokesperson is Tyrone Seale says, “President Ramaphosa said this is a moment of great sadness for all of us who were mesmerised and moved by the power, sensuality and improvisation of Sibongile Khumalo’s unique voice.” “As a music academic, she was also a voice of instruction and inspiration to new generations of artists who had the privilege of learning from a performer who was at the pinnacle of her career. We will miss her greatly.” In the video below, legendary jazz musician Sipho Hotsitx Mabuse pays tribute to Khumalo:
