President Cyril Ramaphosa says the passing of the Minister in the Presidency, Jackson Mthembu, has shocked people into stopping the constant bickering that has been dividing the country. Ramaphosa was delivering the eulogy at Mthembu’s official funeral service, which took place at Sacred Heart Catholic Church in the Ackerville Township of Emalahleni, in Mpumalanga, on Sunday.

He says Mthembu’s death has united South Africans in their sorrow. “One dare hope, that the sentiment that has been displayed at Jackson Mthembu’s passing. We want what is best for the people of our country, which he championed so well,”  the President said.
