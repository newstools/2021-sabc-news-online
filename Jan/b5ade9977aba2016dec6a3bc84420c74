STATEMENT ISSUED BY GAUTENG PREMIER DAVID MAKHURA ON ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THE OFFICE OF THE PREMIER IN PPE PROCUREMENT IRREGULARITIES pic.twitter.com/AVaLq0MpFG — GautengGov (@GautengProvince) January 30, 2021 The Democratic Alliance (DA) has made renewed calls for his axing, with the ANC Youth League calling for him to appear before the party’s Provincial Integrity Commission. The Premier’s Spokesperson, Vuyo Mhaga, says that Makhura asked the SIU to investigate. “The allegations really do not have basis. The only thing that happened is that the judge erred in summarizing a judgement in part of a line. He actually said that the premier was involved in corruption. The premier has also asked the SIU to investigate those particular allegations.” Gauteng Premier David Makhura’s briefing on PPE corruption:  The DA claims more than R2.2 billion has not been accounted for since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March last year. The DA wants Makhura to step aside after being personally implicated in a PPE scandal. The party alleges that it is in possession of an affidavit made by former Gauteng Health CFO, Kabelo Lehloenya in which he implicates Makhura for his alleged involvement in the appointment of six companies to supply PPEs. Gauteng has been marred by a number of PPE corruption scandals with the latest being over R430 million spent to disinfect and deep-clean schools in the province.
