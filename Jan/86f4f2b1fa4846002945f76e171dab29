He says the continent will be open for economic growth. Ramaphosa says, “As we restructure and reform our economy, SA will be open for business – as the entire continent is doing the same, we will through the Africa Free Trade Agreement, be able to say to the whole world that we are open for business. We are moving forward with integration and we are going to be trading with each other and the world must participate with us as we surge forward as a continent.” Ramaphosa’s address below:
