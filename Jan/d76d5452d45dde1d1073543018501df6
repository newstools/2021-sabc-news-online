Five suspects aged between 43 and 60 have been arrested by the Hawks in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape, for defrauding four prominent insurance companies. The suspects allegedly stole more than R280 000. The syndicate allegedly signed up about seven insurance policies with different companies over the period between March 2014 and February 2015. When the waiting period had lapsed, they allegedly forwarded fraudulent death claims. Provincial Hawks spokesperson, Philani Nkwalas, says a case of fraud was reported to the Hawks for further investigation which uncovered more fraudulent claims. The syndicate members allegedly alternated as beneficiaries and deceased persons. “The five suspects are expected to appear at the Port Elizabeth Magistrates Court today facing multiple charges of fraud, theft and defeating the ends of justice,” says Nkwalas. Three of the suspects are still at large, whilst one passed away after a short illness. “The National head of the Hawks Lieutenant General Godfrey Lebeya commended the team for the arrest and looks forward to seeing all those involved being brought before court,” says Nkwalas.
