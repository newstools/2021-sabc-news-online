The trial of controversial televangelist Pastor Timothy Omotoso, and two others will resume in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Tuesday morning. The case was postponed in November last year due to the death of advocate Zukile Mdolombo, who was part of the State’s legal team. He was successful in having Omotoso’s third bail application denied. The Pastor from the Jesus Dominion International Church and two co-accused are facing more than 90 sex-related charges including rape, racketeering, human trafficking and sexual abuse. Omotoso’s application for leave to appeal against the denial of his third bail application was also denied. The court found that he is a flight risk and could flee to any country where his church has a branch. He was also declared a prohibited immigrant and there is a possibility that he will interfere with witnesses. The flamboyant Pastor was arrested at the Port Elizabeth airport in April 2017. He enjoys huge support from congregants. It is expected that the State will call a witness to testify before Judge Irma Schoeman.
