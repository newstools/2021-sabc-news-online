The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Mpumalanga have opened a case against Premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane in Witbank. The party wants the Premier to be charged with failure to wear a mask in public. This allegedly happened during the funeral of Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu on Sunday. Mtsweni-Tsipane signed an admission of guilt statement at the Vosman police station in Witbank and issued a public apology. Below is the premier’s apology: However, Mpumalanga EFF leader Collen Sedibe says they reject the apology of the Premier who he accuses of not leading by example. Sedibe says, “We have opened a case against the Premier for contravening the COVID-19 regulations and mandatory protocol because she was seen in public without wearing a mask during the funeral of Mr Jackson Mthembu in eMalahleni. We did so because the Premier is the Chairperson of the Provincial Coronavirus Command Council and she must lead by example and convey the message to the public of Mpumalanga so that all of us comply with the laws and ensure that we curb the spread of the coronavirus.” Investigation Police Minister Bheki Cele says an investigation must be conducted after Mtsweni-Tsipane was seen without a mask at Mthembu’s funeral. Cele’s statement came shortly after the Premier issued a statement apologising, saying she was oblivious to the fact that her mask had fallen off her face. Encouraged African National Congress National Spokesperson Pule Mabe says the party is encouraged by the Premier’s apology: He says they are encouraged that she owned up to the error.
