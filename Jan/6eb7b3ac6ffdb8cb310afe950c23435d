Gauteng Emergency Services are on high alert following heavy downpours across the province. There’s been no reports of serious flooding in Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni but officials are warning those living in low-lying areas and next to river streams to be extremely cautious. Areas prone to flooding include places along the Jukskei River and the Klipspruit Valley in Soweto. Joburg Emergency Services spokesperson Nana Radebe says, “The City of Johannesburg Emergency Services would like to urge people living in low-lying areas to take precautions and to be careful. It is going to rain the whole week and we are going to check the water levels and in case the water level rises we will have to request them to move up to safer areas. We also want to warn motorists to drive very carefully as the roads are wet and some might be flooded.” If you encounter #flooding on our Joburg roads today, following the heavy downpour of rain, please proceed with caution.
