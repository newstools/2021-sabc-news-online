Kruger National Park disaster teams are on high alert ahead of the landfall of tropical storm Eloise which is predicted to hit the northern parts of the park in Limpopo this weekend. Eloise will become a tropical storm by Friday evening with winds of 120 kilometres per hour. It is expected to cause heavy rain and flooding in Mozambique and parts of Zimbabwe on Saturday and in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga on Sunday. SanParks Spokesperson Isaac Phaahla says some rest camps and gravel roads in the Phafuri region have temporarily been closed. The imminent landfall of the storm has necessitated the closure of some grave roads, picnic sites, bush camps, all located in the Phafuri region. SanParks scientists are in contact with the South African Weather Services and are monitoring the storm in order to advise the teams on the ground. The SanParks says people with confirmed books at the affected camps will be accommodated at the Shingwezi, Mopani and Letaba rest camps. The officials urge everyone who will be at the Kruger National Park this weekend to be extra conscious. ELOISE is expected to reach Tropical Cyclone status and make landfall near Beira in Mozambique. It is then expected to become an overland depression and result in significant rain over eastern parts of SA.
