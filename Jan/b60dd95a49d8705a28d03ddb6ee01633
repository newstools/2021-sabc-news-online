The Western Cape government says the province is ready for the re-opening of schools. This after various stakeholders raised concerns over a wide range of challenges that learners will face in the midst of a second wave of coronavirus infections. Schools across the country are expected to open for the first term on January 27. Premier Alan Winde says they will make input in a national meeting this week regarding the re-opening of schools. “We will make our inputs around schools in our presentation, that our Education Department is prepared and ready for schools to open,” says Winde. In November 2020, the Department of Education in the Western Cape called on young people between the ages of 18 and 35 to take advantage of its programme to recruit more than 20 000 education assistants and general school assistants. The programme started running in December and will continue until the end of March. Applicants should possess a tertiary qualification or a matric certificate and they must be unemployed.
