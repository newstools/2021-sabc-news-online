Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says he cannot continue hearing evidence from former Eskom and Transnet chief financial officer Anoj Singh because it is defective. Zondo, who has given Singh’s legal team until close of business on Monday next week to submit a comprehensive affidavit, has postponed the hearing to a later date. Singh was stripped of his membership last year by the Institute of Chartered Accountants. He was found guilty of improper conduct and gross negligence in breaching the code of professional conduct during his time at the two parastatals. He was CFO at Eskom from 2015 to 2016. Below is the live stream of this morning’s proceedings:  Meanwhile, on Tuesday, former Eskom CEO Matshela Koko told the State Capture Commission that he was shocked that the email messages he had been sending to an anonymous businessman belonged to Gupta associate Salim Essa. The commission provided detailed evidence showing Koko several emails he had sent to an address that belonged to Essa. In December 2020, Koko denied allegations that he had met with the Guptas and their associates. He told the Commission’s Chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that he thought the email address belonged to former Eskom Chair Ben Ngubane as advised by the power utility’s former company secretary Suzanne Daniels.
