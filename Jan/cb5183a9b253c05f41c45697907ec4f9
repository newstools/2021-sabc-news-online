The State Security Agency (SSA) guarded former President Jacob Zuma’s presidential aircraft despite the fact that it had not been catered for in its budget. This was the testimony of Ms K, an unidentified witness, at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Ms K was corroborating the affidavit of Mr Y who was scheduled to testify but is ill. On Wednesday, Ms K testified that the agency had established a protection unit for the sole benefit of the former President during his tenure. “The CDIS incurred approximately R1.5 million a month in unplanned expenditure given the entire CDIS budget for 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 was R48 million and R38 million respectively. That means almost 40% of the CDIS budget was redirected from other operational activities in order to meet the requirements of this project for the alleged protection of the presidential aircraft,” says Ms K.
