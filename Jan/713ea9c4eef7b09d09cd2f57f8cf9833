The Constitutional Court will on Thursday morning hand down judgment in an application to compel former President Jacob Zuma to appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The Commission brought the application in December. Zuma was expected to appear before the Commission in January and February to respond to allegations levelled against him. In November 2020, Zuma walked out of the Commission without the Chairperson’s permission, after failing in his bid to have Justice Raymond Zondo recusing himself as the Commission’s presiding officer. Zuma walks out of Inquiry before he could take the witness stand:  This had prompted the Commission to approach the highest court in the land to compel Zuma to appear before it and to declare his conduct unlawful. The Commission’s lawyer, Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, accused Zuma of using delaying tactics. If the court rules against Zuma, he will have to appear before the Commission in February to respond to over 30 witnesses who have implicated him in wrongdoing.
