Three elephants from the Hluhluwe Imfolozi Park have been killed in the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. This after five elephants were spotted roaming on communal land outside the park at the weekend. Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife spokesperson, Musa Mntambo, says the elephants had escaped from the game reserve. Mntambo says they had to put down the three elephants after they realised that driving them back to the game reserve would pose a threat to the locals. â€œWe managed to push back two by the time when we went back to try and push back the other three that had escaped they were plus-minus seven km into the community area. We realised that to try and attempt to push them back inside the game reserve would be dangerous to the community. We then applied for the destruction permit and three elephants were destroyed after their destruction, Mntambo says. He says they removed the parts that they normally take out when the elephants had been killed and left the remains for the community to feast on them, if they want to.
