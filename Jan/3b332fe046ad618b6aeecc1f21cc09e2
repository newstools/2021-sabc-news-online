The Democratic Alliance (DA)Â  says it will further probe expenditure at the South African Post Office (SAPO), after a written parliamentary question revealed that the entity paid over half a million rand for corporate membership to an Irene Country Club. DA MP, Cameron MacKenzie, says it is unacceptable that the SAPO paid R600 000 over the past eight years on corporate membership while retrenching staff and shutting post offices during the same period. He says during this period several Strategic Turnaround Plans were presented to Parliament where commitments were made to reduce staff and cut unnecessary expenses. During this time the entity also received bail outs to the tune of almost R8 billion . MacKenzie says he will submit more questions on whether similar expenses were made elsewhere in the country, as well as who benefitted from the Irene Country Club membership, whether additional fees were paid for food and drinks among others.
