Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says he is studying the contents of the Public Protector report regarding the adverse findings against Provincial Minister for Local Government, Anton Bredell. He has been found to have violated the code of ethics due to his alleged interference in the appointment of a senior director at the George Municipality in the Southern Cape. Winde’s spokesperson, Odette Cason says, “The Premier along with the legal team are in the process of scrutinising the 26-page report to consider the contents thereof and we will be issuing a statement shortly in due course. What is clear from the onset is that the extent of the remedial action requested, it’s limited to providing the report to the Western Cape Provincial Legislature with comments from the Premier if any.” Suspend Bredell Last year, the Leader of the opposition in the Western Cape Provincial Parliament and African National Congress member, Cameron Dugmore, called on Winde to suspend Bredell. Dugmore says several allegations, including maladministration and abuse of power, have been levelled against the provincial minister. He says there is reportedly a secret recording doing the rounds, wherein Bredell colludes with councillors in the Oudtshoorn Municipality to place the municipality under administration. Dugmore claims that Bredell also destabilised the George Municipality through political interference. He says this happened when Bredell launched an investigation into the municipality’s affairs and colluded with the Hawks during the probe. Bredell has denied any illegality on his part. He says the comments he made in a secret recording, which Dugmore is referring to, is only a 15-second clip out of a two-hour-long Democratic Alliance caucus meeting, which took place in 2019, that has been taken out of context.
