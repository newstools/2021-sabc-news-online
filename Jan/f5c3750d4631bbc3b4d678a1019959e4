The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) has called for the Zondo Commission to have President Cyril Ramaphosa appear before it to answer to allegations of conflict of interest with regards to Eskom. These allegations stem from the testimony of former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe yesterday who claimed that mining company Glencore sold shares to Ramaphosa and made him local Board Chairperson of its Optimum mine in 2012 to gain strategic political advantage. Molefe said even when Ramaphosa became the country’s Deputy President in 2014 and chaired the Eskom War Room aimed at halting load shedding, he still had held onto the Optimum shares which SAFTU says constitutes a conflict of interest. Brian Molefe told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that load shedding came back after Cyril Ramaphosa was appointed President:  Molefe allegedly at the centre of State Capture at Eskom Molefe is alleged to have been at the centre of State Capture at the power utility. Earlier in 2020, the former boss lashed out at the Commission through his legal team claiming the inquiry would prejudice him. Molefe is also being sued by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) for his role in looting billions at the State-Owned Entity. Molefe was seconded from Transnet to Eskom by former Eskom chairperson Ben Ngubane. He is alleged to have abused his power at both Eskom and Transnet and enabled the Gupta’s to secure a vast amount of money through lucrative contracts.
