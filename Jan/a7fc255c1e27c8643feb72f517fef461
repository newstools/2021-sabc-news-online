Weather experts have reported that the cyclone Eloise will affect the north-eastern parts of KwaZulu-Natal from around midday on Sunday. The weather forecaster Julius Mahlangu says it is mostly the north-eastern part of the province that will be affected. “There will be 30% chance of showers and thunderstorms over the south western part but then tomorrow things change. That is when we are expecting the north eastern parts to be feeling the effect of the cyclone Eloise.” “We are expecting quite heavy rainfall especially in the afternoon going into the evening which is where we also had alerts out for disruptive rainfall which might lead to widespread flooding.” Meanwhile disaster management teams have been deployed in Limpopo ahead of the arrival of cyclone Eloise that is expected to hit the province as well as Mpumalanga. The South African Weather Service issued an alert nine for Limpopo and Mpumalanga, warning of heavy rain and flooding. The cyclone made landfall in the Mozambican port city of Beira  early Saturday morning. Limpopo’s Cooperative Governance MEC, Basikopo Makamu, says the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) will be on stand-by to rescue people who might be trapped or cut off.
