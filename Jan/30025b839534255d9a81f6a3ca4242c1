Former Ukhozi FM station manager, Welcome Bhodloza Nzimande, has passed away. In a statement, the family says Nzimande was rushed to hospital after a short illness where he passed away this morning. Nzimande joined the SABC in 1978 as an announcer. He was also the presenter for the show, Ezodumo that promoted indigenous music. Family spokesperson, Zama Mtshana Nomnganga says, “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing away of Welcome – who passed on in the early morning – the early hours of this morning – the 15th of January 2021. It’s really a bad season for all of us especially in the entertainment industry, also in the business sector.” Acting Ukhozi FM station manager Sbongi Ngcobo has described the late Nzimande as a man who encompassed great wisdom. “I would go to him and ask about how things were done in the past and really they say that to get to where you’re going, you have to know where something comes from. The thing I miss about him the most is that I would go to him with something that I thought was a major problem and he would just start off by laughing it just laugh at me and say mango bar it’s ok it’s not that serious and then he will give me a perspective that will really make me leave that meeting feeling like I have just been in the presence of greatness and such wisdom.” Messages of condolences are pouring in for the radio giant:  Sibuhlungu siwumsakazo Ukhozi FM ngokudlula emhlabeni kowayengumphathi wethu ubaba uWelcome Bhodloza Nzimande.
