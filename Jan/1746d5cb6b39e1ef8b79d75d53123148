North West Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs MEC Mmoloki Cwaile says plans are in place to address water shortages in Barseba village outside Rustenburg. Cwaile met with the community after SABC News reported on their plight earlier this week. “It is clear that there is a problem in terms of the decision made on taking the R20 million meant to provide water relief to use it for design when the community suffers with water immediately. So we have directed that money should be made available for immediate relief but secondly for drilling of more boreholes for operations and maintenance,” says Cwaile. North West government says plans are in place to address water shortages in Barseba Village:  After a series of meetings with stakeholders, the community welcomed the intervention. “From what the MEC said to us and what we agreed on, we feel relieved because we have been suffering due to lack of water in the areas Barseba, Modikwe and Bathanie,” says a resident. “The approach that he presented to us gives us confidence that this time this matter will be resolved. The approach is that we don’t spend a lot of resources or money on designs let’s rather do something that is practical that will be tangible and that will deliver water to the residents,” says another resident.
