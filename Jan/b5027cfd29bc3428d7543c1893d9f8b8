Water supply has been interrupted in some parts of the Ethekwini Metro in KwaZulu-Natal following a severe storm. The municipality says the storm damaged critical water infrastructure, including a high lift pump station at Inanda Dam. This has resulted in water shortages in areas in the north, central, south and western parts of Ethekwini. Spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela says that quite a number of reservoirs have been affected. “Following heavy thunderstorms that we have seen at Ethekwini our water infrastructure has to a large extent been damaged. This has affected quite a number of reservoirs that supply a number of areas in the Ethekwini such as Umlazi, Chatsworth Northdene and others. But our teams are working around the clock to return the situation to normalcy, we are hoping that tomorrow evening that is the 2nd of January everything should be back to normal.” The Weather Service has issued a warning of more rain that could lead to localised flooding in the eThekwini area in KZN. Forecaster Wisani Maluleke says the N2 and N3 might be affected. “Over KwaZulu-Natal we are expecting 80% chance of rain and with this rain we have issued an alert of disruptive rain which might lead to localised flooding in some formal and informal areas and roads and low-lying areas and major routes might be affected especially the N2 and N3 routes due to difficult conditions associated with slippery roads and reduced visibility.” Kwazulu Natal Today ‘s Weather overview: 2.1.2021 pic.twitter.com/cIeTr8dHno — SA Weather Service (@SAWeatherServic) January 2, 2021  SA Weather | Saturday 02 January 2021
