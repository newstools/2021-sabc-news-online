Zimbabwe’s Vice President Constantino Chiwenga says government has begun the process of acquiring COVID-19 vaccines. On Wednesday, Chiwenga presided over the burials of Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo, Transport Minister Joel Matiza and the country’s former head of prisons Paradzai Zimondi at Heroes Acre in Harare. The three succumbed to COVID-19 earlier this month. Speaking at the funeral of the three high-ranking officials, Chiwenga said COVID-19 does not discriminate. “It claims the powerful and the weak, the privileged and the deprived, the haves and the have nots. It leaves a trail of despair and desperation, but we will eventually conquer it.” Below is a report by the SABC’s Noma Bolani: Herbal treatment Meanwhile, Uganda has launched clinical trials of a locally produced herbal treatment for COVID-19.
