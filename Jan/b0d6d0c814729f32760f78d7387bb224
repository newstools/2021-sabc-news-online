Gauteng Education spokesperson Steve Mabona has appealed to the community to share information with the police. “As the Department of Education, we are quite dismayed by this incident of criminality which occurred in one of our schools in the Vaal. That’s where criminals went to the school on Thursday, just before midnight, and broke into the school and stole over 40 computers that were presented at the school. We find ourselves with nothing now. It’s quite disappointing. We really call members of the community to share information with the police so that they are apprehended. This area has been terrorised by these criminals. It has been hit twice already.” Over 42 computers stolen at Sapphire Secondary School:
