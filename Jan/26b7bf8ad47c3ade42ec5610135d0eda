The Hawks in the Free State say they are confident that they have a strong case against multi-award-winning Lesedi FM anchor, Motseki “Ba2Cada” Leine. Forty-year-old Leine is facing charges of fraud relating to making false tax submissions. Provincial Hawks spokesperson Captain Christopher Singo says Ba2Cada, who’s currently in custody, allegedly submitted false Value Added Tax returns worth more than R1.7 million. The alleged fraud was committed between 2014 and 2018. Leine will be back in the Bloemfontein Regional Court on the 22nd of next month. Ba2Cada is the co-host of the Breakfast Show on Lesedi FM.
