MediClinic Gariep hospital in Kimberley says it is increasing its oxygen tank capacity at the hospital as COVID-19 cases soar in the province. The hospital says over the first week of January, it experienced a 400% increase in hospitalisations in the facility and used up to 1.6 tonnes of oxygen per day. Oxygen usage in treatment of COVID-19 has reached alarming levels in Western Cape:  The hospital says it is increasing oxygen tank capacity with oxygen tanks being refilled every second day. Hospital General Manager is Stephan Deetlefs says, “It’s difficult but we are coping. Our biggest concern is oxygen but I’m glad to say that we could get an upgrade from our oxygen tank from 6 000 to 10 000 tons. So that will bring a big relief to us within the next few days. Otherwise I think we’re coping. We see that the numbers are stabilizing currently so that’s good for us.” In December 2020, humanitarian organisation, Gift of the Givers, made more high flow oxygen machines available to hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Gift of the Givers founder, Doctor Imtiaz Sooliman, said with these machines a huge amount of oxygen can be given to patients. It has a higher success rate against coronavirus than conventional ventilators. Gift of the Givers donates beds, oxygen machines and PPE to Bhisho Hospital:
