Western Cape authorities have welcomed the deployment of soldiers to help enforce lockdown regulations in the province. The South African military has been assisting police in the Cape Metro with enforcing the COVID-19 curfew since last Thursday. A company of about 170 soldiers has been deployed for at least a month. Working together with city law enforcers and the police, the SANDF has already had a presence in Kraaifontein, Samora Machel and Mitchells Plain, Nyanga, Mfuleni, Phillipi East and Lentegeur. Around 40 SANDF members are also assisting police and municipal law enforcement agencies in the Garden Route area to help maintain compliance with the Disaster Management Act. Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says, “It was the Garden Route that actually asked for the military to help because law enforcement officers were also under threat, but of course, the whole management of the 170 across the province will be under the South African Police Services.” Western Cape hospitals strained from increased admissions:  Military medics have also been requested to assist in rural hospitals in the Winelands. With hospitals taking strain across the province, authorities say it is important that citizens follow COVID-19 regulations to help curb the spread of the virus.
