Families of victims of the Langa Massacre at Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape are threatening to boycott future commemoration of the event, due to empty promises by the provincial government. The families say they are only recognised in March, which is Human Rights Month. The commemoration precinct has become a hotspot for vandals. Twenty people lost their lives when apartheid police opened fire on mourners marching to a funeral in 1985. Zixolise Maseti, who was shot and wounded in 1985, says government has neglected them. “We are saying, we are not going to wait until March, we are going to start with our commemoration now in January. We are going to show them that we are independent. They must stay away from Langa, we are going to show them what we are capable of. “
