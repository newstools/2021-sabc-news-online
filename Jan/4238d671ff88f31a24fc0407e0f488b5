The Leratong Hospital on Gauteng’s West Rand has confirmed that services that were affected by flooding have been restored. The hospital was flooded overnight on Friday following heavy rains. CEO, Dr. Keke Moloi, says all water has been cleared in the X-ray, casualty and frontline areas. “Currently, we have managed to stabilize the situation in casualty, X-ray department and the hospital has been reopened for services. Our cleaners and the disaster management team are also fully functional. The situation has been stabilized but we are still working very hard to make sure that the hospital is clear of the water that is inside.” https://t.co/6hIBSm54Fy — Leratong Hospital (@LeratongH) January 2, 2021  Meanwhile, Johannesburg emergency management services spokesperson Robert Mulaudzi has issued a stern warning to residents in low-lying areas to remain on high alert for possible flooding in the province. This comes as heavy rains lashed large parts of Johannesburg on Friday night. Mulaudzi says floods and damage to homes have been reported in parts of Gauteng – particularly the west. He says while no major incidents were reported, residents living in low-lying areas have to be vigilant during this time. “So far throughout the City of JHB, we have not received any major incidents due to rainfall overnight, however, we still remain on high alert monitoring most of our low lying areas. This would be most of our informal areas throughout the City since we know that when we have rainfalls those would be the hardest hit. We are also monitoring all seven regions of the City so that we can be able to respond to any emergency which might occur.  We have got our swift water unit on high alert.”
