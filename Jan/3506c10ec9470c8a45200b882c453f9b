Latest reports in Malawi say the formal extradition hearing of Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) Pastor, Shepherd Bushiri, and his wife Mary will begin on March 8. The fugitive couple appeared at the Lilongwe Magistrates Court on Wednesday. Malawiâ€™s Director of Public Prosecutions, Steven Kayuni, told the court that the extradition request from South Africa has been formally served and includes charges of theft, fraud, forgery and failing to comply with bail conditions in South Africa. Kayuni also says three additional counts of rape have been added to the charges against Shepherd Bushiri. Reports say the Malawi court has ruled that the couple not be re-arrested pending their re-appearance in court on May 8. Last month, the South African government served Malawi with the extradition request after the Bushiris contravened their bail conditions and fled to Malawi. The submission followed a request for a provisional arrest, which was sent through the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) in terms of Article 10 of the SADC Protocol. The Bushiris are facing fraud and money laundering charges. The Bushiri saga is unpacked in the video below:
