KwaZulu-Natal Economic Development MEC Ravi Pillay says he is concerned about the illegal transportation of alcohol at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Pillay’s concerns follow the arrest of a truck driver on Friday after he was allegedly found transporting approximately 1 890 cases of imported beer with an estimated value of R1.9 million. The alcohol was being transported from a depot in Durban to Johannesburg. Under adjusted alert Level 3 lockdown the sale and transportation of liquor are banned. Pillay says the truck was impounded and the driver charged with the illegal transportation of liquor. “From the information that we received from the police, it would appear this was a blatant violation of the country’s adjusted Level 3 lockdown regulations. The regulations are clear on the sale dispensing and transportation of alcohol during this period and the law must therefore take its course. We are dealing with a very dangerous pandemic that is rising at an alarming rate. Many families have lost their loved ones to the pandemic, the nation is losing frontline workers on daily basis. Alcohol has been identified as a key contributor to the spread of this virus.” INFOGRAPHIC | SA COVID-19 AMENDED LEVEL 3 LOCKDOWN REGULATIONS President Cyril Ramaphosa announced in the last week of December 2020 tighter coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions following a surge in new infections during the festive season.
