The Congress of the People (COPE) says President Cyril Ramaphosa has stopped consulting opposition parties on steps government is taking to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The party has accused the President of using opposition parties as rubber stamps for decisions the government and the African National Congress (ANC) are making. In a statement, COPE spokesperson Denis Bloem says they are sick and tired of listening to announcements, the basis for which they have not been informed. “The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine has become a big secret. Only the governing party, the ANC, knows the details. We want to know what the budget is for this massive project. We want to have details on the strategy for distribution. Who will be in charge of this massive project?” In the video below, President Ramaphosa addresses the nation on developments in COVID-19 response:
