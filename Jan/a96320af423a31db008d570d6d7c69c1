China said on Wednesday it would take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights of companies, after US President Donald Trump signed an order banning US transactions with eight Chinese apps. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying was speaking at a regular news briefing. Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese software applications, including Ant Group’s Alipay mobile payment app, the White House said, escalating tensions with Beijing two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. China says delistings of its telecoms will “only hurt” US interests. “The direct impact of this sort of oppressive nature against Chinese companies certainly has its limits. But in the end it will only hurt US national interests as well its own image. It will damage the US’s position in the global capital market. We hope that the US will respect the rule of law, respect the market, and do more that is beneficial to the order of the global financial market, protect the legitimate rights of investors, and do more to serve the stable development of the global economy,” says Chunying.
