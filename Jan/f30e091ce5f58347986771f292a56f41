Former Eskom Group CEO Matshela Koko is expected to testify at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg on Tuesday. In December 2020, the former Eskom executive denied allegations he met with Gupta associate Salim Essa at Melrose Arch in Johannesburg where they allegedly discussed the suspension of Eskom executives. In the video below, Koko testifies at the commission in December 2020:  Former Eskom Company Secretary Suzanne Daniels alleged that Koko had a meeting with Essa where they discussed the looming suspensions. During his last appearance at the Commission, Koko denied even knowing Essa at the time. Koko gives another testimony at the commission:  “It did not happen, I did not know Salim Essa in 2015. I put it to you [to] go check my telephone records, go and probe whatever intelligence you can employ, you will not find my contacts with Mr Essa either telephonically or on the emails.” “Ms Daniels met with Mr Essa on the 10th. I did not have a discussion with Mr Essa and Ms Daniels about the suspensions.” Meanwhile, Acting Eskom Fuel Resources Senior Manager, Dr Ayanda Nteta, is expected to continue testifying today.
