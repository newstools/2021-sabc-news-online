The family of businessman Shonisani Lethole, who died in Tembisa Tertiary Hospital last year, and the Justice for Shoni campaign are demanding the immediate suspension of the hospital’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The family held a virtual press conference on Thursday after Health Ombud, Professor Malegapuru Makgoba, released his findings on Lethole’s death in 2020. The Ombud had found that Lethole had received sub-standard care and has recommended that the Gauteng Health Department institute a disciplinary inquiry for negligence against 19 staff members, including nurses and doctors. Medical negligence to blame for Shonisani Lethole’s death: Ombudsman  Before his passing, Lethole had tweeted Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize about being starved at the hospital. “The last seven months since we lost our son have been so traumatising. As a family, we had to undergo counselling. Not knowing what happened to Shonisani has been hard. My son died a lonely death without the basic care that we should be able to expect in our healthcare facilities. There were many failures in my son’s treatment. For the first 2 days of admission, he was not fed,” says Patricia, Shonisani’s mother. Lethole says the family is still battling with his death. On Wednesday, Makgoba said he has requested a forensic audit into the Tembisa Tertiary Hospital in Ekurhuleni, which will look at issues such as corporative governance, the relationship between nursing staff and doctors as well as the processes of the hospital when dealing with patients. Health Ombud findings into patient’s death at Tembisa Tertiary Hospital  The #HealthOmbud findings on the #ShonisaniLethole death are shocking. The report makes a strong case for us to reflect on the #Ubuntu deficit among us, including some of our health professionals. We need a #kindness–#Ubuntu revolution and reset for all our sakes. #SocialJustice https://t.co/1QnXMZB3Dg — Prof Thuli Madonsela (@ThuliMadonsela3) January 27, 2021
