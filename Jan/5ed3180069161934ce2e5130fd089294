The SABC has been reliably informed on Saturday that the African National Congress (ANC) Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) in North West has suspended the membership of Premier Job Mokgoro and others in the provincial legislature. The IPC says some of its members within the provincial legislature, including the premier, were colluding with opposition parties. The IPC has accused them of voting with opposition benches during the election of a new Chair of Chairs. — SAfm news (@SAfmnews) January 30, 2021 The spokesperson for the ANC IPC Kenny Morolong wouldn’t be drawn into commenting. “Well, we cannot confirm or deny these reports. All I can say is that we’ve got a scheduled press conference, at which we will expound on these matters.”
