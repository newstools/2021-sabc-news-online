The community of Dudumeni at Mbizana in the Eastern Cape has expressed outrage after the body of a female police officer was found hanging from a roof at her home. Eyewitnesses say both her hands were tied behind her back and the throat half cut. A few meters from her home, villagers spotted a police vehicle dumped near a soccer field. Inside was the body of a young man with a police firearm on top of him. Ward 8 councilor Lonwabo Somadlangathi says villagers want the police to conduct an extensive investigation into the deaths. “This thing is shocking. The community is very shocked because this thing has never happened in this community. Nobody thought such gruesome killings could happen in this village. We want the law to take its course because the community is very shocked and this thing is very painful, very bad, I cannot even explain. Police are yet to release a statement into the case.
