The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it was reckless for Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula to exclude vehicle licenses and license disks from the extension period for renewal. In a statement, the party called on Mbalula to implement an online renewal system. The Justice Project earlier warned that the Minister’s earlier promises, which included the license disks in the extended grace period until 31 August, has still not been gazetted. On Saturday, the Department of Transport released a statement excluding vehicle licenses or license disks from the extended grace period. The department says the 30 November gazette is still applicable, but the latest gazette includes license disks in the extension validity. CLARITY ON THE EXTENSION OF VALIDITY OF LICENSES The Department of Transport clarifies the public that the Government Gazette of the 30th of November 2020 announcing the extension of licenses did not include vehicle licenses/licenses disks. pic.twitter.com/AU2VeGWEa8 — 𝙼𝙴𝙳𝙸𝙰 𝙻𝙸𝙰𝙸𝚂𝙾𝙽 | 𝙴𝚜𝚎𝚝𝚑𝚞 (@EsethuOnDuty) January 9, 2021  Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula issues directive on expired licenses:  The DA says Mbalula has recklessly disregarded the call by the President to avoid any sort of large gatherings, by forcing car owners to queue for license disks. “The COVID-19 pandemic is literally ripping through South Africa, with a recorded 21 606 new infections reported on January 9 and an average of 400-500 mortalities per day for the last seven days. If it is so necessary for government to prohibit South Africans from accessing beaches, and enforcing strict curfew times, they should at the very least, meet citizens halfway and provide them with relief through other measures,” the party says. The party also wants government to implement an online renewal system. The Minister replied to the DA on Twitter, saying the government will consider their request.
