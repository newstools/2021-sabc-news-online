President Cyril Ramaphosa has again re-assured South Africans that the government will find the COVID-19 vaccine at an appropriate time. Ramaphosa said the statement at the Khayelitsha District hospital, where he honoured healthcare and other frontline workers for their effort in fighting the deadly virus. The President chose one of the country’s COVID-19 hotspots to appreciate and thank frontline workers. He was joined by other dignitaries and religious leaders in lighting a candle in their honour. This, at the time when the government is under fire for what critics say is its delay in finding the vaccine, while other developing countries are already rolling it out. But the President is calling for patience. “Yes, the vaccine will come, we’re making all efforts and I spent the better part of today so that we can save the lives of our people,” he says.

At least 71 healthcare workers in the Western Cape have died due to COVID-19. The President used the opportunity to declare 2020 the year of healthcare workers. “You have given life to many of our people, you have saved lives and tonight we honour you, we want to respect you.” Meanwhile opposition parties are pressing the government to cancel the R10 billion bailout to SAA, and instead use the money to secure the COVID-19 vaccine.
