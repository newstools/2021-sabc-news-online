Firefighters from the City of Cape Town have battled a fire at Site C in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats in the early hours of this morning. City Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson, Jermaine Carelse, says scores of residents of the Taiwan informal settlement have been displaced after the fire gutted their dwellings. Carelse says despite the extent of the blaze, in strong windy conditions, no fatalities have been reported. “On the scene, we had 13 firefighting appliances and a total of 56 staff members. Although the strong winds posed a challenge to the firefighters they managed to contain and extinguish the blaze at 05:25. A firefighter was taken to the hospital just after 01:00 as he was suffering from muscle spasms.”
