The case of three police officers implicated in the murder of Eldorado Park teenager Nathaniel Julies has been postponed to the February 26 in the Protea Magistrates’ Court in Soweto. The officers from the Eldorado Park police station were arrested for Julies’ death in August last year. Two of the officers have been charged with premeditated murder, defeating the ends of justice, discharging a firearm in public and unlawful possession of ammunition. The third accused has been charged with accessory to murder. Two of the suspects appeared in the dock on Wednesday morning while the third accused participated in court proceedings via CCTV from prison. Their case has been postponed for the indictment to be signed and for a trial date to be set. Simon Ndyalvane and Caylene Whiteboy are currently behind bars after being denied bail in September last year. Vorster Netshiongolo secured bail at his second attempt in December. Julies, who had down syndrome, was shot just a few metres from his home. His death sparked outrage in the community. In the video below, his family members called for justice:  Frustration over delays In November last year, the teenager’s case went through another delay after the court heard that state is still awaiting the post mortem report. Frustrated over the numerous delays, Julies’ mother expressed her unhappiness. “I’m not doing well, hearing all those things going on. Now it’s the post mortem, tomorrow, it’s another story. For a boy to be brutally killed, this is how they handle the matter. I’m really upset as I am a mother, I’m disappointed. Who are these people delaying these things? What’s going on? Is the system going to fail us again?” The court proceedings in the video below:
