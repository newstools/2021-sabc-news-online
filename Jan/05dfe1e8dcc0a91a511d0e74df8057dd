Motorists will pay more for fuel from Wednesday. The Central Energy Fund (CEF) says the price of 93 octane fuel will increase by 43 cents per litre, while 95 octane will increase by 40 cents per litre. Diesel will increase by 54 cents and 55 cents per litre while illuminating paraffin will increase by up to 55 cents wholesale price and 74 cents retail price. The CEF says the average international product prices for petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin increased during the period under review. The rand appreciated against the US dollar on average when compared to the previous period. This led to a lower contribution to the basic fuel prices.
