African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa says the Coronavirus Command Council will meet with Health MECs on Sunday ahead of January 15th when the Alert Level 3 lockdown regulations will be reviewed. Ramaphosa said the council was concerned about the rapid increase in new coronavirus cases. “The National Coronavirus Council has met and we are now going to meet with our provinces tomorrow, after that cabinet will also look at some of the recommendations coming from our net-joints, our Health Department and it is then that we would be able to make a determination and announce it to the nation. We are concerned about the continuing spike in infections,” says Ramaphosa. The country is expected to get a coronavirus vaccine from India in January and February. Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize speaks about the sharp rise in COVID-19 infections:  Ramaphosa says he is confident that government will win the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The country’s cumulative number of coronavirus infections has reached 1 192 570 and 616 more people have succumbed to COVID-19 related complications in the past 24 hours, putting the national death toll at 32 425. Ramaphosa says government is training healthcare workers as it intensifiess its fight against the pandemic. “So many South Africans have joined in the fight against COVID, from individuals to organisations, churches, traditional leaders, political parties, you name it. Are we well equipped, I would say that we have been getting equipped as we have been confronting this challenge. We had a lockdown initially so we can be better prepared,” says Ramaphosa.
