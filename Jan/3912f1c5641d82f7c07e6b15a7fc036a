He conducted over 50 000 interviews that informed Americans in a clear and plain way. New York sends condolences to his family and many friends.” National Political Correspondent Steve Kornacki “Larry King was a radio and TV legend with an insatiable curiosity about people and a real sense of humor. He could get anyone talking, from Hollywood stars to the guy on the corner. In the 1990s, Larry King Live even became the most important show in American politics. RIP.” “RIP Larry King.. one of the only talk show hosts who let you talk. Legendary.” ITV Presenter Piers Morgan “Larry King was a hero of mine until we fell out after I replaced him at CNN & he said my show was ‘like watching your mother-in-law go over a cliff in your new Bentley.’ (He married eight times so a mother-in-law expert) But he was a brilliant broadcaster & masterful TV interviewer.”
