Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has outlined protocols to ensure that the marking of the matric examinations continues uninterrupted even if any personnel tests positive for the coronavirus. Marking is expected to begin on Monday at over 180 centres and involves more than 45 000 markers. The guidelines state that if any person displays symptoms typical of COVID-19 they will be placed in a separate isolation room and must seek medical attention before they are allowed to resume marking. All markers that test positive for the virus will not be allowed to continue marking and if it is determined that a person has lied about being negative, they will be charged with misconduct. The Department says it has developed a list of reserve markers to ensure that marking is not disrupted. Every marking centre will have a COVID-19 Compliance Officer and arrangements have been made to have a health practitioner on site or in the vicinity of each marking centre. @DBE_SA Creating a conductive environment for marking of matric exam scripts which starts Monday…. pic.twitter.com/vyjnYvtDdX — Elijah Mhlanga (@ElijahMhlanga) January 2, 2021  The Minister of Basic Education, Mrs Angie Motshekga, has issued a new set of directions and protocols as part of the final preparations ahead of the start of the marking of the 2020 matric examinations scripts. pic.twitter.com/Nl3NuoitII — Dep.
