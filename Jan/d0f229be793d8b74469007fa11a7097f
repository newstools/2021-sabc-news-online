The KwaZulu-Natal government has urged residents to go to hospital as soon as they experience COVID-19 symptoms. This as the province continues to rank first in the country in terms of the number of active cases, and the fourth highest countrywide in terms of fatalities. The KZN government says the infection rate continues to increase in several districts which include Ethekwini, Umgungundlovu and Uthukela. Over the last seven days, the province has recorded 29 147 new infections.

That is very reckless because there is a growing body of evidence and scientific evidence that proves that it is possible to get re-infected.” Vaccine rollout Zikalala also says the Provincial Coronavirus Command Council will announce a rollout plan for the COVID-19 vaccine this coming week. “We are putting in place a plan that will ensure that we roll out accents vaccines faster when they become available. Our starting point is education and awareness and debunking the myth that, unfortunately, surrounds the vaccine because for us, this will be an important – the race to save lives. We are increasing our testing and screening capabilities. We are working on vaccination sites in all the districts of our province, ensuring that they are in good state of readiness.” Hospitalisations The KZN government says provincial hospitals are not yet full, but the numbers are increasing and the number of people succumbing to COVID-19 has also increased. Health MEC, Nomagugu Simelane Zulu says they have seen a trend of a growing number of people who go to hospital when they are too ill. “We found that in the past few days, those that are presenting at our facilities, they present with extremely low oxygen stats in the body and once we have very low oxygen within your system, it becomes extremely difficult to pull it up. Some actually make it but some don’t. I’m glad you asked that question because it gave me the opportunity to make this call again to say can people really go to our facilities and be told there whether it’s necessary to admit you or not.” Zikalala has urged people to continue to be vigilant.
