Deputy Basic Education Minister Regina Mhaule has announced that both public and private schools will open for learners on February 15. Addressing the media from Pretoria, Mhaule said this is to avoid further burdening health facilities following the second wave of COVID-19. Private schools had requested government to keep them open, however – Mhaule  says they too are expected to delay school opening by two weeks.

School management teams will report for duty on Monday 25 January 2021, teachers shall follow Monday 1 February, learners return on Monday 15 February.” Below video, Mhaule addressing a media briefing:
