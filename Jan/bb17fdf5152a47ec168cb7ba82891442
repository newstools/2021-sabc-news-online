The Free State Health Department has named the Thabo Mofutsanyana and Fezile Dabi districts as the two COVID-19 hotspots during the second wave of the pandemic. Illegal cross-border movement between Lesotho and Thabo Mofutsanyana, as well as social interaction between communities in the Eastern Cape province and Xariep districts have also pushed up infections. Thabo Mofutsanyana District has reached 12 684 infections. A major concern is that the area is densely populated with high poverty levels and inadequate access to amenities. Access to water is also a challenge to the residents. Free State Health MEC, Montseng Tsiu says illegal cross-border movement remains a major challenge. “The province is also gearing up to receive its first batch of the coronavirus vaccine within the first quarter. Health workers, the police, teachers, correctional services employees, and other essential service workers are set to be prioritised. Ultimately, 1.9 million of the 2.9 million population is earmarked for vaccination. This is aimed at rendering the community non-infectable. District Health System Chief Director Dr. Grace London those that are vulnerable will also be prioritised when the vaccine is rolled out. “One of the phases is that once we have actually vaccinated all the essential workers, we will then live to dissect the population that is vulnerable which is your 60 and above. So, this is where we will start vaccinating. This will form part of the 1.9 of the 2.9 population in the Free State.” Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela has appealed to the youth to avoid gatherings to lower COVID-19 cases. “Now, things are becoming bad in our hospitals in the districts. The virus has, in recent days, been spreading at an alarming rate across our province. We are seeing the younger generation being infected due to their lifestyle choices.” Communities have been urged to use non-pharmaceutical protocols such as social distancing, washing of hands, and self-isolation to curb the spread of the pandemic. The Free State has 70 891 confirmed cases and 2 473 coronavirus fatalities.
