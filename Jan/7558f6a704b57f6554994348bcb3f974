Speaker of Eastern Cape Legislature Helen Sauls-August, African National Congress Deputy Chief-Whip Kholiswa Fihlani and a staff member have all tested positive for the coronavirus. They are currently in self-isolation. The provincial legislature is currently in recess until January 18. Legislature Spokesperson Lwandile Sicwetsha says, “The Speaker urges Eastern Cape citizens to remain compliant with all COVID-19 health and safety regulations of wearing a mask, observing a social and physical distance and regularly sanitising or washing of hands. She encourages all those who show flu symptoms to self-isolate.” Parly commended The National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) has commended Parliament for its COVID-19 response. However, Parliament has remained mum on the number of infections and deaths among its employees. It has been conducting its business virtually. Nehawu Parliamentary Secretary Themba Gubula says Parliament has been hands on in terms of complying with the COVID-19 protocols. “We say this because as far back as 2020 March when the COVID-19 situation became serious, the South African Parliament was amongst the first to ask its employees who could work from home to do so, in an endeavour to reduce the number of employees that could congregate in the parliamentary precinct. Parliament further moved swiftly to establish what we call a COVID-19 rapid response task team. A committee that comprises heads of departments in parliament as well as union.”- Additional reporting Abongwe Kobokana.
