Home Affairs Director of Ports of Entries Stephen Van Neel says the enforcement of the curfew might affect the movement of travellers through all the ports of entry around the country. He, however, says the ports will be operational as provided for in the operating hours. The Civil Aviation Authority has issued airlines in the country with a notice advising them to amend their flight schedules in accordance with the adjusted Alert Level 3 lockdown regulations pertaining to the curfew. The curfew runs between 9 pm and 6 am. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the tighter coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions in December following a surge in new infections during the festive season. The President moved the country from Alert Level 1, which has the most relaxed regulations, to an adjusted Alert Level 3 with moderate restrictions. No national or international flights will be allowed to depart or arrive between 9 pm and 6 am. International travellers will have to provide a negative PCR test not older than 72 hours before the date of travel.  Long-distance taxis and buses will still be allowed to operate at 70% capacity. The department has proposed that long-distance buses and taxis be allowed to complete their journeys if these fall within the curfew hours. The ban on passenger ships and cruise liners remains in place with only cargo and small vessels allowed to call on South African ports. More of the Alert Level 3 restrictions:
