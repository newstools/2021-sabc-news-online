Sassa beneficiaries who went to re-apply for their disability grants in King William’s Town in the Eastern Cape are accusing the institution of not creating a conducive environment to render services. They say for over a week, they have been sent from pillar to post with no indication of whether there is any progress in solving their problems. They say they are sometimes forced to approach loan sharks to make ends meet. Sassa could not immediately be reached for comment. Mzameki Sulani who suffers from epilepsy says they keep telling her to come in some other day after coming in for an entire week. “They told me to come the following day which I did. Then they said I must come back on Monday, I came here the entire week last week. I am still here as you can see but no one really cares about us here. I have had to go to loan sharks to get money which I will have to use this very money to repay. I really hope that they can assist us so that we get this money and pay back the people we owe.” Sassa in the province could not be reached for a comment. 52-year-old Siyabulela Sajini lives with a disability and says coming to SASSA offices frequently is risky for him. “I am not happy at all because this up and down is expensive. I am a person living with a disability, even my hands are not working such that if I fall, I cannot get up on my own, I have to be assisted. These people are inconsiderate, they do not even supply us with chairs, as you can see I was leaning against the wall when you got here.” SASSA beneficiaries in King William’s Town feel left out
