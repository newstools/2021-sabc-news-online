Rebel fighters have attacked and partially occupied a diamond mining town in Central African Republic, according to humanitarian and security sources. The incident took place in Bangassou, around 300 miles east of the capital Bangui, on Sunday, the day before the results of a presidential election were due to be announced. Rebels, who the government and United Nations say are backed by ex-president Francois Bozize, launched an offensive in December. Central African Republic head to polls, but rebel violence threatens the elections:  That was after Central African Republic’s constitutional court rejected Bozize’s candidacy for last Sunday’s (December 27) vote. Bozize’s party officially denies he is working with the rebels, though some in the party have suggested they are working together. According to the UN’s mission in Central African Republic, at least five rebels were killed and two army soldiers wounded in the Bangassou clashes. After hours of fighting on Sunday, rebel fighters entered Bangassou, sources said, but it was not clear to what extent they were in control of the town. An army spokesperson said he did not have information about the situation and a UN mission spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
