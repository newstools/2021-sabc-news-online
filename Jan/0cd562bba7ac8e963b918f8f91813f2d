The slopes of the Twelve Apostles mountain at Camps Bay are being monitored following a mountain fire that flared up yesterday in strong winds in Cape Town. City Fire spokesperson Jermaine Carelse says the fire was put out late yesterday, but as a safety precaution firefighters are still on scene to detect smoldering embers that could lead to another flare-up. The Victoria mountain road near the fire that was closed yesterday has been opened to traffic again. Carelse says the other vegetation fire yesterday at Red Hill, South of Cape Town, has been extinguished and resources have been withdrawn. On Saturday, firefighters from the City of Cape Town battled a fire at Site C in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats. City Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson Jermaine Carelse says scores of residents of the Taiwan informal settlement have been displaced after the fire gutted their dwellings.
