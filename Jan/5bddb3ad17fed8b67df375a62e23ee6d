The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has sought to explain issues regarding the processing of temporary disability grants and a lack of service points. The agency has come under harsh criticism after last week’s chaos during which the police used a water cannon on crowds at its office in Belville in the Western Cape to ensure social distancing. Sassa has cited lack of funding as one of the reasons affecting the processing of temporary disability grants.

Sassa says a three-month extension of disability grants would cost R1.2 billion, funding which is not available. Projected expenditure for the financial year shows the agency will be left with just over R411 million to be utilized where necessary; an amount far less than the needed R1.2 billion to extend temporary disability grants.
