Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has thanked frontline healthcare workers for their efforts to help keep members of the public safe from the coronavirus. Winde says it appears the province has reached its peak of the second wave of COVID-19 infections. He says currently there are about 3 500 patients at public and private health facilities. Winde says nearly 70 tons of oxygen are being used a day to treat affected patients. “Our medical frontline workers have been absolute stars and of course, the other frontline workers from law enforcement to municipal services and of course, you the citizen, thank you very much for helping us flatten the curve.  Please keep it going, remember social distancing, washing hands, masks.  Remember that also if you’re feeling at all sick, stay at home, follow the protocols, call our numbers. Let’s all stay safe.” Meanwhile, Winde says he is concerned about the number of COVID-19 cases on the West Coast. He says he plans to visit the region soon. Saldanha Bay currently has more than 750 active cases; Bergriver more than 430; Cederberg over 170; and Matzikama more than 400 cases. The Western Cape has more than nearly 44 000 active COVID-19 cases at the moment. Winde says he’ll continue visiting areas most affected. “I will also be continuing my visits to hospitals and making sure things are still under control, we’ve got sufficient beds, sufficient oxygen in place in the province. Probably, the West Coast a bit later. I’m a bit worried about the numbers on the West Coast. Please, people on the West Coast let’s keep flattening the curve.”
