Zimbabwean investigative journalist, Hopewell Chin’ono, has been granted bail after spending three weeks in prison. The journalist was arrested earlier this month and charged with communicating falsehoods after he tweeted that police had beaten an infant to death while enforcing COVID-19 lockdown regulations. This was the third time that Chin’ono was arrested in the last six months. Chin’ono has become an easy target for Zimbabwe’s government and police. His previous bail conditions limit his use of his social media and this is how the current charges were brought forward. Zimbabwean journalist and government critic Hopewell Chin’ono arrested for the 3rd time in 6 months:  Before the latest arrest, Chin’ono was out on bail on separate charges of inciting violence after he voiced support for an anti-government protest in July. He was also charged with contempt of court for allegedly claiming there was corruption within the country’s national prosecution agency. Chin’ono’s investigative work has exposed deep seeded corruption in government. His last piece unveiled tender corruption in the country’s Department of Health which led to the dismissal of then Health Minister, Obadiah Moyo.
