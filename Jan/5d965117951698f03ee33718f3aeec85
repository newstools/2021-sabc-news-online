Founding member of the Congress of the People (COPE) and former African National Congress (ANC) MP Mluleki George has died. George was also a founding member of the United Democratic Front. He was former deputy minister of defence. He formed COPE with Mosiuoa Lekota and Mbhazima Shilowa and contested the 2009 national elections. COPE Spokesperson Dennis Bloem says his passing is great loss to the country. “This is a massive loss to the country. Cde George gave everything to see his people and the country free. Indeed the country has lost another patriot who loved his country.” “Cde Mluleki George was also a founder member of a break away party from the ANC in 2008, the Congress of the People which was formed after Jacob Zuma was elected as President of the ANC. Cde George was very vocal at the Polokwane Conference, warning the delegates that the ANC is taking a wrong direction and with Zuma as the leader he will not only destroy the ANC but the entire country, but the delegates did not want to listen and Zuma was elected,” says Bloem. Bloem further says Mluleki George’s contribution to the attainment of freedom in the country will never be forgotten. “What we enjoy today is because of the selfless sacrifices that comrade George made.” The party has also sent its condolences to his family and friends.
