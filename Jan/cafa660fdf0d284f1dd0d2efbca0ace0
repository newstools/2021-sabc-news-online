Three people died and ten others were critically injured in a multi-car pileup on the N1 road at Tobias, outside Mookgophong, Limpopo. It’s believed that the driver of one of the vehicles lost control and collided with three others, including a truck. The provincial Transport Department says a tyre burst might be the possible cause of the crash.
