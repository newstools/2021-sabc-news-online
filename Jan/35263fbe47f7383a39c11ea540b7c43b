The African National Congress (ANC) has paid homage to the martyrs of the Matola Raid. Yesterday marked 40 years since the apartheid government attacked ANC members in Mozambique, killing at least 13 Umkhonto we Sizwe members. The ANC, in a statement, says the lives of those comrades are not forgotten and will continue to live on through the party. “As we commemorate this historic day and pay tribute to our fallen soldiers who died with their boots on, we must never forget their selflessness and sacrifices. They laid down their lives in pursuit of freedom and justice. These are the true martyrs whose lives were taken in cold blood and with naked brutality,” reads the statement. The Matola Raid led to the acceleration of the struggle for liberation, with the armed struggle, mass action, underground work and international solidarity against apartheid being intensified.
