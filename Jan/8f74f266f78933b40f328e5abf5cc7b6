Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has scored a decisive election victory to win a sixth term, the country’s election commission said on Saturday, but his main rival Bobi Wine denounced the results as fraudulent and urged citizens to reject them. The 76-year-old Museveni, in power since 1986 and one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders, dismissed the allegations of fraud in an evening address to the nation, saying Thursday’s election may turn out to be the “most cheating free” since 1962.
   
Addressing the nation from his rural home on Saturday evening, the president, wearing his signature hat, touched on varied themes in a more than one hour-long victory speech.    
   
Hundreds of Museveni supporters celebrated his victory in the capital of Kampala, riding motorcycles and dancing with posters bearing the president’s face. Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni wins sixth term in office: Frederick Goloba-Mutebi
