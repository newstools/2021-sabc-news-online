The Department of Health in the North West says services at Tshepong Hospital in Klerksdorp are continuing as normal. Pictures have been circulating on social media showing the hospital flooded with water following torrential rains. The Department says the cause of flooding was a blocked stormwater drain in the street. MEC Madoda Sambatha refuted allegations that the roof was leaking. “The photos that were circulating, when you go to the hospital there was never a problem with water coming from the roof, it is only water that was flowing from road to the hospital. So in that instance, the Department is working with the municipality and the municipality is already fixing the problem with its drainage system. The was not damaged that was caused that would have needed the removal of patients.” The MEC assessed the hospital yesterday. #NorthWestHealth MEC Madoda will today visit Tshepong Hospital in Klerksdorp to assess the impact of flooding. The COVID-19 ICU, Out Patient Department (OPD), Pharmacy, cleaning department, admission ward 14 and maintenance office were the flooded areas. pic.twitter.com/L5VgzLPtdp — North West Health (@NorthWestDOH) January 15, 2021  As part of intervention all patients who were in casualty were safely moved to unit Area to be managed there.
