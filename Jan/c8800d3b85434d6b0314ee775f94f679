Health workers’ union, Nehawu, has accused the Free State department of health of failing to adhere to COVID-19 protocols. Nehawu says the department has not intensified its measures at healthcare facilities in the province, since the second wave of coronavirus. Pressure is mounting on frontline workers as cases are on the rise. So far, 47 health practitioners have succumbed to COVID-19 in the province. Nehawu Regional Treasurer, Mathabang Nqoko, says Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) are given to selected staff members according to their scope of practice. “Our concern is the patients that are flocking in and they are not being managed is like we are still on level one. Secondly, we are still concerned about the PPEs on the basis that the employ has decided to select who has or wears the universal PPEs according to the scope of practice whereas Nehawu we feel that each and every worker should be that universal PPE.” According to the South African Medical Association (SAMA), healthcare workers are under severe strain trying to cope with the resurgence of COVID-19 new infections and deaths in the country. South Africa has reported another record number of cases in the last 24-hour cycle. The national health department last night reported, 21 832 new coronavirus infections, taking the total number to 1 149 591.
