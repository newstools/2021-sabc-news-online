The office of the Master of the High Court of South Africa in Pretoria says it has opened a criminal case with the police against three of its officials. The three are alleged to have solicited a bribe from a member of the public who had approached the office for assistance in the issuing of a letter of authority. The office issues the document regarding the executorship of property. The document facilitates the terms of handing the estate of a deceased person to the right executor. Justice and Correctional Service spokesperson Chrispin Phiri says the office acted on a tip-off from a member of the public. “The public is reminded that the services of the Master of the High Court are provided free of charge. In this regard, we wish to emphasise that there are no circumstances that require a member of the public to exchange cash with a member of staff at the offices of the master.” “The public are encouraged to report incidents of corruption to the National Ant-Corruption Hotline: 0800 701 701 (toll free number),”adds Phiri.
