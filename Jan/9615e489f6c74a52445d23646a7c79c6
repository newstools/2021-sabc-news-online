The State Capture Commission of Inquiry continues hearing testimony related to the State Security Agency on Tuesday afternoon. Earlier, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo dismissed the application by State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo for a postponement of Acting Director General Loyiso Jafta’s testimony. Zondo said no factual basis was provided by Dlodlo to support the claim that Jafta’s testimony may compromise national security.
