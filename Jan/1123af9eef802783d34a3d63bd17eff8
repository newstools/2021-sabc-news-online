The funeral of the former Deputy Minister of Defence and founding member of the Congress of the People (COPE), Mluleki George, is under way in King Williams Town in the Eastern Cape. George died of COVID-19 complications last week. He was also heavily involved in sports administration, and since his death, those efforts and the impact he had on creating unified sports bodies have been lauded. Speaking at the funeral via telephone, the President of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc), Barry Hendricks, says George was steadfast and brave with everything he committed to, saying he taught his contemporaries a lot. “His principles and values of non-racialism, human rights, and bravery. His unselfish approach to sports unification and development and his unmatched negotiating skills. He was a gift to us and we were lucky he shared his time with us. We continue to strive to work towards his vision and ideals. We will work to entrench and grow his legacy,” adds Hendricks. In the video below, Dennis Bloem speaks on Mluleki George’s passing:
