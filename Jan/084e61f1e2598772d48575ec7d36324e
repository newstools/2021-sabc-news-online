The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport says it is on high alert following threats and allegations of disruptions within the freight industry. Acting MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Kwazi Mshengu, says they will be in Durban’s hotspot areas to assess the effectiveness of law enforcement. Mshengu has tasked law enforcement agencies to act swiftly against those who are threatening to shut down major transport routes in the province. He is expected to visit the Durban Central Police Station and the Durban Harbour on Sunday evening. “MEC Mshengu said all law enforcement agencies in the province are on high alert to avert any possible disruption to traffic and protest action on our provincial and national corridor. He added that police have developed a comprehensive tactical enforcement plan targeting key hotspot areas,” says the department’s spokesperson, Gugu Sisilana. Sisilana says the MEC has received a high-level briefing from the police management in the province and is satisfied with the level of preparations and the security plan that has been developed. He has warned that those that attempt to disrupt traffic and attack any freight transport will face the full might of the law because government is not prepared to negotiate with criminals, adds Sisilana.
