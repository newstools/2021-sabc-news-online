The Democratic Alliance (DA) will not regain control of Knysna in the Western Cape following a council meeting which saw them being voted out. Last year, the party said it would take over the municipality after securing an alliance with the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP). However, one secret ballot denied them the opportunity, ensuring that the council remained in the hands of the African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of the People (COPE) and Knysna Unity Congress Alliance. The DA’s constituency head in Knysna, Dion George says they’re disappointed with the outcome. In December last year, the Knysna Municipality had several shock resignations during a virtual council meeting. It’s alleged the resignations were spurred by interference from an outside organisation. Those who resigned included the acting municipal manager, the chief financial officer and a DA ward councillor, as outlined in the video below:
