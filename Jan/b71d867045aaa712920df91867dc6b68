The SABC has welcomed the Labour Court’s dismissal of the Broadcasting, Electronic, Media & Allied Workers Union’s (Bemawu) application for leave to appeal an earlier judgment in favour of the SABC’s handling of the Section 189 process that could see over 300 workers lose their jobs. This after the Labour Court dismissed Bemawu’s application, with costs, to declare the Section 189 process as irregular in December. Bemawu wanted the process to be declared irregular and procedurally unfair. But the court on Friday dismissed its appeal with costs. SABC COO Ian Plaatjes explains:  According to the statement released by the broadcaster, the court “ruled that there was simply no reasonable prospects that another court could come to a different conclusion, based on the facts presented by Bemawu and their failure to prove that there was a material failure in the Section 189 process.” The SABC says, “The Labour Court has – once again – validated the SABC’s Section 189 process as being procedurally fair and that all participating stakeholders were afforded ample opportunity to engage meaningfully.” Bemawu’s Hannes du Buisson reacts to the court’s judgment on its application
