The African National Congress (ANC) has vowed to restore the legitimacy of the local sphere of government by dealing with corrupt councillors. This came out at the end of its three–day NEC Lekgotla held virtually at the weekend. The Committee is the highest decision-making body of the ANC between conferences. The Lekgotla began on Friday to focus on four key areas identified in the January 8 Statement. During the Statement outlining the party’s program for the year,  ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa said the ruling party would focus on areas including the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery and reconstruction, local government and service delivery as well as moving to a better Africa. Closing the meeting, which was also attended by former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma, Ramaphosa said they want to ensure transparency and accountability at all municipal levels in a bid to improve service delivery. “The Lekgotla was unambiguous in its resolve to strengthen consequence management in municipalities through strengthening public accounts committees, acting against public servants conducting business with municipalities, increasing transparency of supply chain management systems, and strict enforcement of the listing of municipal officials and service providers implicated in maladministration. The ANC and Alliance need to ensure that there is accountability and transparency and must remain focused on the developmental needs of our communities at all times,” says Ramaphosa.
