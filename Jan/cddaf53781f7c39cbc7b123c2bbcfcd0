Four alleged cash-in-transit robbery suspects have been killed during a shootout with police at a safe house in Katlehong on the Gauteng East Rand. According to a statement from the office of the Police Commissioner, the shootout followed a CIT robbery in Edison Street in the Langlaagte Industrial area on Friday morning. “It is reported that this morning, a group of armed men allegedly used explosives to bomb an armoured vehicle in order to gain access to the safe. The suspect made off with undisclosed amount of money, leaving the vehicle they have used to ram the armoured vehicle off the road burning. One of the security guards was taken to hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound to the head,” reads the statement in part. Police recovered two police radios, an unlicensed firearm and two vehicles, one which had been hijacked in Katlehong last month and the other was hijacked in Sandton two weeks ago. A manhunt for an unknown number of suspects that managed to flee the scene has been launched. The police have appealed to “anyone with information on the whereabouts of the remaining suspects to kindly call our Crime Stop number ‪08600 10111‬ or to send tip-offs on My SAPS App.
