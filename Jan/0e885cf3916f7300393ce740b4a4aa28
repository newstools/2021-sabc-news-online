ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa says the party’s Integrity Committee will be strengthened to enable it to effectively deal with ANC members that are facing criminal charges. Delivering a virtual address of the party’s January 8 statement to mark the ANC’s 109th anniversary yesterday, Ramaphosa reiterated his call for those facing serious charges to voluntarily step aside until their court cases are finalised. “We reiterate a resolve by our 54th National Conference that any member accused of or reported to be involved in corrupt practices should account to the Integrity Committee immediately or face disciplinary processes. Members who fail to give an acceptable explanation or to voluntarily step aside while they face disciplinary processes, investigative or prosecutorial processes will be summarily suspended. The NEC will soon finalise guidelines on the implementation of these resolutions. It is only if we stand united against corruption that we can restore the integrity of our movement.” ANC members must ensure the party wins 2021 LGE Ramaphosa also reminded members of their responsibility to ensure that the party wins this year’s local government elections (LGE). Ramaphosa’s address below:  Ramaphosa says party members must seek to endeavour that the ANC restores public confidence which has been eroded by allegations of corruption. “With governance comes great responsibility,  the ANC must win public confidence by progressively meeting the needs of the people, accounting to communities deploying the most capable cadres to positions of responsibility, managing public resources, ethically and acknowledging our weaknesses. This is the message that every ANC member should take to heart in 2021. “
