Gauteng Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo says he is pleased to see that holidaymakers and commuters who are making their way to the province are complying with lockdown regulations. Mamabolo has joined law enforcement personnel at a roadblock on the N17 in Leandra at the border between Gauteng and Mpumalanga on Monday. He says similar roadblocks will be mounted across Gauteng. “With respect to COVID-19 compliance – both from public transport and private motorists – it’s that the message seems to have reached the people. Because what we are seeing is that everybody who is passing through the roadblock is wearing a mask and we are also seeing that people are carrying their own sanitisers, public transport has their own sanitisers and people are confirming that when the taxis leave the taxi ranks they do get sanitised.” Traffic volumes Gauteng Traffic Police say traffic volumes have begun increasing as holidaymakers make their way home to the province from various parts of the country. Motorists are advised to obey the rules of the road and take intermittent breaks. They are also urged to avoid driving at night.
