Doctors working at Melomed Hospitals in Cape Town say the second wave of COVID-19 infections has been especially hard to cope with. They say the high rate of daily cases which the Western Cape experienced during the peak placed a great deal of strain on their mental well-being and their ability to deliver services. However, the number of active daily cases has now decreased. Head of Melomed Hospitals’ Trauma Unit, Dr Rafeeq Abrahams, says their teams have been working non-stop throughout the pandemic in order to heal the sick. Abrahams says, “For all the frontline workers it has been a very, very difficult time, a very trying time. I cannot begin to express how difficult it is for some of these doctors to get up every day and face their fears and come into the emergency units. Thankfully we work with a great group of doctors. They selflessly would come in and put their fears aside and put the country and all the sick patients first.” Western Cape healthcare system under pressure:
