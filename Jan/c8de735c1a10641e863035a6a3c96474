Struggle stalwart Johnson Mlambo has been described as a steadfast Africanist by his son Nhlamolo Mlambo. Nhlamolo was speaking at the funeral of his father taking place in Daveyton on Gauteng’s East Rand. Mlambo succumbed to COVID 19-related complications on Sunday last week after being admitted to a Johannesburg hospital two days before. He was 80. Mlambo spent 20 years on Robben Island maximum-security prison and on his release in 1983 joined the PAC’s mission in exile. Nhlamolo Mlambo told mourners: “I know my hero, I know my father, I know his legacy. My sister, my mother we breathe his ideology – the African cause, the Africanist cause because that was all that he knew, that is all that he gave us. I am telling you that my father had two books before he passed only two books – the bible and any book about Sobukwe those are the two texts he kept next to his bed. You can go to his bedside right now, the bible and Sobukwe they go hand in hand.” The video below is of the funeral service:
