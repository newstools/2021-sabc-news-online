Police in Lesotho have retrieved the bodies of seven people from the Mohokare river at the Ficksburg border in the Free State between South Africa and Lesotho. The first body was discovered just before Christmas, with the last body retrieved last night. It is reported that itâ€™s mostly people who were trying to cross into South Africa and most of them were using what seemed like mattresses. It is understood that the number of bodies could be more.
