ANC MP and Parliament’s Home Affairs Portfolio Committee Chairperson, Bongani Bongo, says the late Presidency Minister Jackson Mthembu was very vocal against corruption. Bongo was paying his last respect at the Mthembu home in the Ackerville Township in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga. Bongo, who is facing corruption charges, is challenging the ANC’s call for members accused of serious crimes to “step aside” from all leadership positions in the party, pending the finalisation of their cases. He says he often debated and disagreed with Mthembu on the principle of stepping aside. Deepen COVID fight ANC Deputy Secretary General Jesse Duarte has called on South Africans to deepen the fight against COVID-19 in Mthembu’s memory. Also speaking outside the Mthembu home, Duarte called on citizens to protect and defend one another against the virus. “The only we can respect one another as comrades Jackson…people’s commitment in fighting against the virus,” she said. Politicians visit the Mthembu family home in Emalahleni:  Mthembu will be laid to rest on Sunday and President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver the eulogy. The anti-apartheid activist died on Thursday from COVID-19 related complications. Deputy President David Mabuza will pay tribute to him at his memorial service at the Government Communication and Information System Auditorium in Hatfield, Pretoria, on Monday. The memorial was originally scheduled to take place today but was postponed following consultations between the Presidency and the late Minister’s family.
