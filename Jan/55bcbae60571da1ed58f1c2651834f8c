The City of Cape Town says it is aware of planned protests today against the closure of its beaches. It says while it supports the call to reopen beaches and public open spaces, officials have been compelled by law to ensure that COVID-19 safety regulations are adhered to. The closure of beaches is a national regulation within the Disaster Management Act. Cape Town Mayor, Dan Plato, has written to the President Cyril Ramaphosa, asking for the lifting of the ban. A poster circulating on social media indicates that the protests are expected to take place in Cape Town, Plettenberg Bay, and Port Elizabeth. City of Cape Town spokesperson for Law Enforcement, Wayne Dyason, elaborates: “Cape Town is still considered a COVID-19 hotspot, until further notice from national government. Beach lifeguards are on duty with a skeleton crew of no more than six per beach, as part of the City’s pro-active engagement strategy. Although swimming is currently prohibited, these lifeguards are patrolling the recreational beaches with the specific objective of interacting with people who might be transgressing the national COVID-19 regulations.” Below is a report on beaches along Cape Town’s Atlantic seaboard:
