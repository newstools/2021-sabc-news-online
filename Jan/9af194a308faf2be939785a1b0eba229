The African National Congress (ANC) in Limpopo says it is confident that the axed members of the Mogalakwena Local Municipality Political Management Team (PTM), will tender resignations following the decision of the party’s national dispute resolution committee. The three, including mayor Andrina Matsemela, were sacked last year December but are yet to tender their resignations. They appealed the party’s provincial leadership’s decision to remove them at the party’s national dispute resolution committee and lost. ANC removes Mogalakwena Local Municipality mayor, speaker and chief whip:  ANC provincial spokesperson, Donald Selamolela, says the axed PMT will have to resign with immediate effect to show discipline. “They had appealed to the National Executive Committee for the national dispute resolution committee but the fact of the matter is that decision has been made and we expect all the three to abide by the particular decision. Because the said structure has also expressed itself on the matter it remains a deployment matter and remains a special terrain on the provincial executive committee.” Political analyst, Levy Ndou, says the best option for the ANC to remove the unwanted political management team will be to use its majority in the council through a vote of no confidence. “There are some options that the ANC would have the ANC might then use its majority in the council in collaboration with other political parties to remove its own members but at the end of the day is a sign of ill-discipline and those people should face the disciplinary process of the party.”
