Officials have warned that some services have been affected by flooding at the Leratong Hospital on Gauteng’s West Rand after heavy rains. The Provincial Department of Health says parts of the hospital were affected. However, it says patients in the facility have not been directly affected. Department Spokesperson, Kwara Kekana, says: “The x-ray area and the front area were affected. No patients were affected by flooding in the hospital. Further assessment of the damages have been carried out by facility management at this stage. We are appealing to the community of the West Rand District to please be patient as some of the services in the hospital may be delayed as a result of the flooding.” https://t.co/6hIBSm54Fy — Leratong Hospital (@LeratongH) January 2, 2021  Meanwhile, the Weather Service has issued a warning of more rain that could lead to localised flooding in the eThekwini area in KZN. This comes after a severe storm damaged some infrastructure in the metro, leading to water shortages in many areas. Forecaster Wisani Maluleke explains: “Over KwaZulu-Natal, we are expecting 80% chance of rain and with this rain, we have issued an alert of disruptive rain, which might lead to localised flooding in some formal and informal areas and roads and low-lying areas and major routes might be affected, especially the N2 and N3 routes due to difficult conditions associated with slippery roads and reduced visibility.”
