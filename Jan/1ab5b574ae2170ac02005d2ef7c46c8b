The Ministerial Advisory Committee on COVID-19 has made recommendations to the Health Department over the use of therapeutic bronchoscopy in the treatment of people suffering from COVID-19. This, as questions have been raised over its use in the removal of mucus from the lungs in patients suffering from the infection. The MAC did not recommend the routine use of the treatment, saying it posed too high of a risk to patients and healthcare workers that would perform the procedure. It added, however, that the procedure could be used as an intervention in patients suffering severe cases of COVID-19, but under strict protocols in order to minimise the risk to healthcare workers. Questions have been raised about the use of a therapeutic bronchoscopy for mucus removal in patients with #COVID19. Read more about why members of the Ministerial Advisory Committee said
