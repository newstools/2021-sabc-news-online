KwaZulu-Natal Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu has rejected calls by teachers’ unions to close some of the marking centres in the province due to COVID-19 cases that have been detected. Mshengu has revealed that a second marker passed away on Monday. The teacher was working at the Inanda Seminary marking centre in Durban.

Mshengu visited the marking centre at Umlazi Comtech High School together with KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala. Mshengu says he believes current measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at marking centres are adequate. “We disagree totally with those calls because we believe that all our centres in the province have actually been prepared such that they are a safe environment for markers to be there and to do their work in a very conducive environment. So, the call to close our centres actually does not accord with the realities of our centres.” Mshengu and Zikalala visit a marking centre in Umlazi:
