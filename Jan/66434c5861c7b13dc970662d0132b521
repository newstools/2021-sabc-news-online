South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) Chief Executive Totsie Memela Khambula says they are doing all they can to facilitate a smooth process for those reapplying or renewing their temporary social grants. There’s concern that a nationwide rush to apply for grants could be exposing many people to the risk of contracting COVID-19.  Sassa Ceo, Ms Totsie Memela and Mr Bandile Maqetuka (Regional Executive Manager for Western, Eastern and Northern Cape regions) also monitored frontline service delivery in Western Cape earlier today.#SASSACares #StaySafe pic.twitter.com/ybnHELifRl — SASSA (@OfficialSASSA) January 14, 2021  Long queues formed outside SASSA offices in Gugulethu on the Cape Flats and Bellville in Cape Town on Friday.

What we have done is that we have started the queue at the back because we realise we have a challenge here, everybody was pushing each other. We understand that because people are desperate,” says Khambula.
