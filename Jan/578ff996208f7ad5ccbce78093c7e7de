The High Court in Pietermaritzburg has dismissed with costs the application of French arms company Thales’ challenge of Racketeering and money laundering charges against it. Thales and former President Jacob Zuma are facing corruption charges in connection with the multi-billion-rand arms deal in 1999. Thales argued in its application that the head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) was mistaken in authorising a racketeering charge. Thales argued that the head of prosecution did not have evidence of its involvement in the alleged corrupt relationship between Zuma and his former financial advisor Schabir Shaik. Meanwhile, the case against former President Zuma and Thales has been postponed to the 23rd of February. In the video below, is the report on Zuma and Thales’ case postponement in December last year
