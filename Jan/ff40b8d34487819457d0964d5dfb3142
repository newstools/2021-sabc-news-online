The cumulative number of tests conducted to date is 7 882 846. 575 11 761 1 392 568 7 882 846 151 208 40 076 1 201 284 *As at 22 January 2021 1 241 360 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Dr Mkhize added: “In the past week we have observed a decline in transmission as evidenced by reduced new cases daily, a steadily decreasing positivity rate (19% today from a high of 36% in this wave), and promising evidence of downward deflection of admission numbers. We are hoping that this decline in numbers is going to bring the much required reprieve to our overwhelmed health facilities, both in the public and private sector. We are closely monitoring this to inform our process of recommending the review of some of the restrictions that are currently in place.
We are very grateful to all South Africans for playing their role in mitigating the devastating effects of COVID-19.” He cautioned: “We do, however, continue to caution that the transmission rate is still very high and we need to ensure that it is reduced to an acceptable level before we can ease restrictions. It is therefore imperative that we do not not grow fatigued and continue to focus on the things we know provide protection- strict wearing of masks, social distancing and regular sanitisation of hands and surfaces.” As of today, the total number of confirmed #COVID19 cases is 1 392 568, the total number of deaths is 40 076 and the total number of recoveries is 1 201 284. pic.twitter.com/S5UBOfrubC — Dr Zweli Mkhize (@DrZweliMkhize) January 22, 2021
