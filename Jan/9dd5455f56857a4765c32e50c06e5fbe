Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital has confirmed that it has not had trauma patients coming in on 1 January, a first in the hospital’s history. This after South Africa moved from Level 1 to an adjusted Level 3 of lockdown including a 21:00 curfew, in intensified efforts to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus. On Monday, President Ramaphosa made the announcement following a high resurgence of COVID-19 cases and a new variant of the virus. The sale of alcohol has also been banned until January 15, when the situation will be reviewed. “Night clubs and businesses engaged in the sale and transportation of liquor will not be allowed to operate. The Level 3 restrictions will remain in place until 15 January 2021. These measures will be reviewed at that time on the basis of the state of the pandemic in the country,” stated Ramaphosa. Remarkably quiet thankfully. Hopefully today will continue in that manner. Jan 1st is traditionally busier than NYE as people are normally so drunk that they present late to casualty. — Dr Peter B-S (@drpeterbs) January 1, 2021  We also had no trauma cases the whole night, the curfew and the alcohol ban has really helped. — Moloko (@_Moloko_M) January 1, 2021  The state of @ChrisHaniBara Hospital on New Year’s Eve. A rare sight at the facility. The relief from trauma cases is much needed for healthworkers and the system. pic.twitter.com/IHmAsiXO6i — Kwara Kekana (@KwaraKekana) January 1, 2021  Enforcing lockdown Level 3 as COVID-19 cases soar
