The Kuruman Magistrates’ Court in the Northern Cape has sentenced a 32-year-old man to life imprisonment and a further 26 years for the rape and robbery of two pregnant women. Tshepiso Oliphant was found guilty of raping the women twice in different incidents during 2012 and 2013 and robbing them of cash and cellphones. According to the police, Oliphant was arrested in September 2013 and was granted bail but did not show up in court. He was re-arrested in September last year. Northern Cape police spokesperson Colonel Mashay Gamieldien says, “The first rape occurred when the 18-year-old victim was lured by the accused to promised land in Mothibistad where he took her to an open field and raped her twice. He also robbed her of her cellphone and money.” “The second incident occurred when the 29-year-old victim met the accused at the hiking spot next to the  Kuruman Court. Both the victim and accused climbed into the same vehicle and when they stopped he also got out with the victim. He then grabbed her and dragged her into an abandoned house where he raped her twice and also stole her cellphone and cash,” explains Gamieldien. Meanwhile, in November, the African National Congress (ANC) Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) in the North West requested the mayor of Lekwa-Teemane Local Municipality in Christiana Mpho Pilane to step aside. This after 36-year-old Pilane was charged on two counts of sexual assault, rape and abduction. He allegedly sexually assaulted and raped two girls. Pilane was granted bail of R1000 by the Delareyville Magistrates’ Court.
