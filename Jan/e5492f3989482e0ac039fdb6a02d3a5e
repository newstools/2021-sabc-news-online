The Social Security Agency (Sassa) has refuted reports that it has suspended over 200 000 temporary disability grants due to a lack of funds. Sassa says the temporary disability grant, which provides financial assistance to people who are unable to work due to injury or illness, is subject to a medical review. Sassa CEO Busisiwe Memela-Khambula says, “It is definitely not true that we have run out of money because these grants are temporary disability grants which ordinarily as they get issued, as a result of a medical condition, the doctor would say the individual’s condition will improve in the next 6-12 months, hence it is a temporary disability grant…” “If your medical condition still persists, you need to go back either to the clinic or your doctor to make an assessment of your condition to see if it persists. Then you come to Sassa, we give you a form, you apply for a grant,” added Memela-Khambula.
