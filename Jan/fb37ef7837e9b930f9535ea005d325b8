Lobby group Afriforum and trade union Solidarity have given government until next Wednesday to fully explain the roll-out plan for the COVID-19 vaccine, or face court action. Afriforum’s Ernst Van Zyl says allowing the private sector to purchase and distribute the vaccines would make their roll-out more efficient and corruption free. Van Zyl says, “Afriforum argues that the government monopolising the vaccine drastically infringes on the basic rights of all South Africans. The private sector’s participation in the purchasing and distribution of the vaccines is essential for the protection of constitutional rights of access to healthcare. Apart from the possibility of abuse of power by the government, its track record of corruption and maladministration during the pandemic does not inspire confidence in anyone at all.” Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance  says it supports the Western Cape Government’s plans to procure the vaccine independently of the African National Congress led government. First batch Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has announced that the country will be receiving the first batch of vaccines this month and another next month and the AstraZeneca jab will be given to healthcare workers. He says priority will be given to the more than one million health workers for both the private and the public sector.
