Social media users call for Mpumalanga Premier, Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane’s arrest. A social media uproar ensued after images of her without a mask surfaced over the weekend during the late Minister Jackson Mthembu’s funeral. On Sunday, Mtsweni-Tsipane released an apology with an explanation of what happened regarding her no-show mask at the gravesite. In her explanation, she claimed that the mask had come loose and that she was not aware of its absence until later. “Upon arrival at the cemetary and disembarking from her vehicle, the premier’s mask was damaged and the premier was oblivious of the fact that it had fallen off. The premier was of the belief that the mask was intact, as had been the case throughout the proceedings.” Many have disputed her claims on social media platforms, citing footage from earlier in the day, after the premier left the podium after speaking at the funeral, saying there is footage of Deputy President, David Mabuza indicating to her to put a mask on. The minister is then seen nodding her head and walking by Mabuza without heeding his call to put on the mask.
