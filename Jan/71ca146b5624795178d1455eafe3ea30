Police and the South African Health Products Authority have arrested a suspected bogus doctor and her assistant at Molteno in the Chris Hani District in the Eastern Cape. The suspects were allegedly found doing business at their surgery and police immediately arrested them. The assistant is believed to be the boyfriend of the bogus doctor. The operation followed information received from Crime Intelligence in September 2020 that one of the suspects was practicing without a licence and operating as a medical doctor in Molteno. The reports further alleged that she was not registered with the Health Professional Council of South Africa, but nonetheless was dispensing medication to patients. Police spokesperson Thembinkosi Kinana says an intensive search was conducted at the surgery and medication estimated at R700 000 as well as used and unused needles were confiscated. Acting Provincial Commissioner, Major General Thembisile Patekile, hailed the success of the operation and further expressed concern about the unending degree of fraud and corruption in the society. “As the management of the SAPS in the Province, we are on record as having warned people against fraudulent activities on many occasions. Those who are adamant and believe these are only idle threats must suffer the consequences of their actions.” The two suspects, the bogus doctor and her assistant, will be charged for Fraud and Contravention of Medicine Act No 101/1965 and are expected in the Queenstown Magistrate’s Court today. #sapsEC Bogus doctor and alleged assistant arrested for fraud.
