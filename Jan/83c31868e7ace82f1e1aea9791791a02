Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Nqaba Bhanga says he is confident that he will remain in his office even after the election of a Mayor. On Tuesday, the Port Elizabeth High Court ordered the Speaker to have a re-run of the election of the mayor within seven days. This was an out of court settlement after Cooperative Governance MEC Xolile Nqatha approached the court to have Bhanga’s election declared invalid. The court has now suspended the invalidity of the election. Bhanga says these elections will bring certainty to the residents of the Nelson Mandela Bay. He says, “We wanted stability in this metro, our people want stability. We want to make sure that they are stable and certain who leads them, and we didn’t want to get into a long case of a dispute. I offered myself and I said ok, because we are so strong as this coalition, we can call another election and we discussed this with the lawyers and put an offer he agreed also. I’m a mayor as I speak, there won’t be a time until that day of council that I won’t be a Mayor.” Bhanga was elected mayor on December 5, 2020:
