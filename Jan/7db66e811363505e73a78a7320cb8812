The City of Ekurhuleni has warned of possible flooding in low-lying areas due to the persistent rain that’s been falling over Gauteng’s East Rand. Residents have also been cautioned to keep a close watch on children to avoid drownings or being swept away by flooded streams. Ekurhuleni’s disaster and emergency services are monitoring the situation and are on high alert. Meanwhile, traffic disruptions were reported across parts of Gauteng, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal earlier as wet weather conditions persisted on Monday morning. The South African Weather Service says several areas have been placed on high alert as Tropical Storm Eloise, which has now been downgraded to a tropical depression, makes its way into the country. The storm made landfall in Mozambique’s coastal province of Sofala on Saturday before moving towards South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana and eSwatini. The downgrade means that heavy rains are still expected but that the impact of strong winds has decreased.
