A woman has died after being shot on Wednesday during the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, a spokesperson for the Washington police department said. No other details were available, the spokesperson said. It remained unclear who shot the woman. Hundreds of Trump supporters entered the Capitol on Wednesday in a bid to overturn his election defeat, forcing Congress to postpone a session that would have certified Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the November 3 election.  Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that lawmakers would resume the count of electoral votes to confirm the November election result once the US Capitol is cleared after pro-Trump rioters breached the building. She said that decision was made after consultations with fellow congressional leaders and calls to the Pentagon, Justice Department and Vice President Mike Pence. “We always knew this responsibility would take us into the night. The night may still be long but we are hopeful for a shorter agenda, but our purpose will be accomplished,” she said in a statement.
