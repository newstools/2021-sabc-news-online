Zimbabwean police have arrested the Movement for Democratic Change-Alliance‘s Spokesperson, Fadzayi Mahere. She is being charged with communicating falsehoods in relation to her tweets criticising the government’s poor service delivery across the board. Mahere is the third person to be arrested in less than a week under the same charges. Another MDC leader, Job Sikhala, and investigative journalist Hopewell Chinono were taken into custody last week. As Zimbabwe experiences its second wave of the coronavirus pandemic and a hard lockdown, it seems the second wave of crackdowns on alleged dissidents is also being implemented. In 2019, several people, who openly criticised the government, were arrested and a few abducted and tortured. In this video, SA’s special envoy was deployed to Zimbabwe to meet with President Mnangagwa:  Mahere was charged at the Harare Police Station. She’s being accused of publishing or communicating a statement carrying the risk of inciting or promoting public violence or endangering public safety. Her colleague and reporter, Chin’ono is in court on Monday under the same charges. The pair is currently arguing to be released in a remand hearing at the Harare Magistrate’s Court. Human Rights commentators claim the ZANU-PF regime is unlawfully targeting the opposition.
