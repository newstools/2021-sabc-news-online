The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) has approached the Electoral Court to postpone by-elections scheduled for January 20th, the 23rd and the 17th of February. This follows the implementation of COVID-19 Level 3 lockdown restrictions amid the second wave of the coronavirus. The lockdown curtails political activities. The court application seeks to extend the 90-day period within which by-elections to fill councillor vacancies must take place. By-elections are scheduled in 14 wards across six provinces affecting over 163 000 registered voters. The IEC says all political parties have been consulted and support the postponement. By-elections 2020: The by-elections, which will affect nearly 172 000 certified voters, will be contested by 77 candidates. The 77 will be representing 14 political parties along with 18 independent candidates. IEC Deputy CEO, Mawethu Mosery, said there were no reports of difficulties throughout the day. “We are appreciating that the community is accepting them in the manner that they are in and we have no report of difficulties throughout the day. So, the special votes are proceeding well, but also they become a dry run for our logistics for the voting day and to the extent that we were able to be operational in all the 118 voting stations on schedule today (Tuesday). We are confident that tomorrow (Wednesday) logistically should not be a major problem.”
