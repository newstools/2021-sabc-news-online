The man accused of shooting and killing a 50-year-old petrol station owner Kobus Fourie at Church street at Klerksdorp in the North West has been remanded in custody by the Klerksdorp Magistrate’s Court. Phemelo Pudieng will remain in custody until his second court appearance for bail application this coming Wednesday where he will be facing a murder charge. Pudieng was arrested last week Tuesday following a police operation at Stateng Section of Bethanie near Brits. Following a tip-off, police arrested Pudieng at his mother’s house. It is alleged that two brothers, one whom owns the petrol station, were about to enter their vehicle when approached by three armed suspects. A scuffle ensued between Fourie and one of the suspects, during which Fourie was shot in the chest. He later died at hospital. The suspects then fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash. – Report by Sylvester Serame
