Limpopo Health MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba says the COVID-19 vaccination programme will be intensified next week when the roll out of the vaccinations will be extended to villages across the province. On Friday, the provincial department vaccinated more than 16 000 teachers and support staff with the Johnson and Johnson single dose. The province plans to vaccinate over 30 000 employees by the end of the weekend at 37 sites. Ramathuba is currently monitoring the vaccination process as it continues today at the Seshego Hospital in Polokwane. She says vaccines must be taken to the people. “We have drawn a programme – that outreach programme is going to be in full force from next week, Monday to Thursday. It’s dedicated to vaccinating the community. You will see us moving from one village to another, you must take the vaccine to the people. If you remain in your comfort zone to say people will come to Pietersburg Hospital to be vaccinated, you are not going to reach the numbers that you need.” Limpopo continues vaccination of educators:  She is confident that by Saturday, 38 400 qualifying education sector employees in the province would have been vaccinated. Ramathuba says their 37 vaccination sites will be administering the vaccines to the education staffers.  Ramathuba says they do not want any disruptions to the ongoing vaccination programme of the elderly which happens from Monday to Thursday at all sites. Ramathuba has also urged people to stop spreading false information about vaccines.
