The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture says it understands that the public wants it to complete its hearings and work but says an extension is needed to do it properly. The Commission announced on Thursday morning it would be applying to the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria for a three month extension of its deadline. Oral evidence will be completed by the end of July, while the report will be finalised by the end of September. The Commission was supposed to have finished oral hearings by the end of last month.  [Earlier] DCJ says the commission will still continue to hear the evidence of other 5or 6 implicated witnesses including the evidence of the President in his capacity as the President of ANC and the President of the country. #SateCaptureInquiry — State Capture Commission (@StateCaptureCom) June 17, 2021  Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says the extension is important given that they have to hear evidence from another six implicated people including President Cyril Ramaphosa. “But the one thing I will not do is this, I will not end the work of the Commission in an irresponsible manner.

In seeking to complete hearings of oral evidence we will  act properly and in [a] responsible manner,” adds Zondo. Today’s proceedings below:
