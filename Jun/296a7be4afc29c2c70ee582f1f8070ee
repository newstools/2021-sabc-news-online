The African National Congress (ANC) in the North West has strongly condemned, what it says is, over expenditure totalling more than R6.5 million for the purchase of face masks by the North West department of Education. This emerged after claims of the irregular appointment of a service provider by provincial education authorities to buy face masks for teachers and learners. Initially the department was supposed to procure 100 000 masks at a cost of R2.5 million – but another 300 000 masks were allegedly added to the order and the cost ballooned to over R9 million. ANC spokesperson in the North West, Kenny Morolong, says this information is contained in a statement issued by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU). “This report surfaced at the time when we should be pre-occupied to saving human life. we call on law enforcement agencies to act appropriately against perpetrators . we also call upon competent courts of law to ensure that justice  is administered without fear, favour or prejudice” says  Morolong.
