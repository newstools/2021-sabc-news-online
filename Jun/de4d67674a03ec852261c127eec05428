The Communist Party of Swaziland (CPS) has called on the army and police of Eswatini not to commit acts of violence and intimidation against the people of that country. The party says the people are protesting for freedom, democracy and rights. But in an attempt to return the situation to normal, the government has introduced a curfew. The CPS says the country is at a crucial point in the long struggle against an autocratic monarchy. It is calling on support from trade unions and others for the unbanning of all political formations as well as the safe return of exiles. It further wants Parliament to be disbanded and a broadly representative interim administration to be appointed. Communist Party of Swaziland’s Pius Vilakati discusses the root causes of the protests: Meanwhile, the government of Eswatini has described the ongoing protests as criminal. Some of the ports of entry, especially on the side of Eswatini, were reportedly closed. Acting Prime Minister Themba Masuku has assured residents of Eswatini and the international community that the situation will be returned to normal.
