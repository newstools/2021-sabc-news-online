The Sun City Resort, in the North West, has temporarily closed following the President’s announcement on the banning of gatherings and alcohol sales as well as stringent level 4 lockdown measures. Sun International says they had to take a decision to temporarily close in line with new COVID-19 levels in order to protect not only visitors, but their staff and the local community. Group COO of Hospitality at Sun International, Graham Wood, says the restrictions make it difficult to operate. “Taken together the new restrictions on leisure travel, closure of casinos, the curfew, restaurant closures, and the alcohol ban make it difficult for us to operate. The prohibition on leisure travel into and out of Gauteng affects Sun City as Gauteng is a key source market for our Resort. We are also mindful that Gauteng is now the epicentre of the third wave so we have a duty to protect our staff and our local communities. We remain hopeful however that the worst of the latest COVID-19 outbreak will have subsided 14 days from now so that we can safely reopen the resort,” adds Wood. All Sun International restaurants, casinos, hotels and resorts are temporarily closed in line with new COVID-19 regulations.
