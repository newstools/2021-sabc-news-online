The Department of Basic Education says the learners enrolled at hostels and special schools have until Friday to be released for their winter holidays. All public, private and independent schools must stop teaching and learning on Wednesday. This after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the winter school holidays will start earlier, as the country battles the third wave of the coronavirus. Addressing the nation on Sunday night, Ramaphosa said the country will be operating under adjusted Level 4 lockdown restrictions for 14 days. Speaking during a media briefing, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says schools will reopen on the 19th of July. “We will use Thursday and Friday for teachers and managers to close the schools properly. We also agreed that learners in hostels and learners with special education needs waiting for parents to pick them up should report the latest by Friday. So if you have a child who is somewhere at a special school, please make arrangements that the latest, if not by Wednesday, the latest Friday 12:30 there should not be any learners at hostels or learning facilities” AUDIO: Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says schools will reopen on the 19th of July:
