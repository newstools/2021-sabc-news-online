The Sol Plaatjie Municipality in Kimberley says plans are on the table for another water pipeline in the city, due to the population growth. The city has experienced water shutdowns for the last four years. Water has been restored to the city this morning, due to a shutdown that started on Thursday. The municipality says it had to work on maintenance on the bulk water system. “Of the population growth, we definitely will need such, but that is dependent on the availability of funds. The distribution of Jojo tanks and borehole water tankers did assist though, even though it was a bit hectic in some cases. We managed to distribute them as far as possible. But it is unfortunate that we don’t have the means to place Jojo tanks at every street corner.” says Municipal Spokesperson Sello Matsie.
