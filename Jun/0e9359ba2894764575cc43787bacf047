The Deeds office in central Pretoria has been shut down. Protesting workers are denying members of the public and staff access into the building. The Public Servants Association of South Africa (PSA) says the building will remain shut until their demands are resolved. They are complaining amongst others about an increased number of staff member testing positive for COVID-19, and congestion in the office. Workers representative, Thomas Ngobeni, says the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, which is in charge of the office, has failed on numerous occasions to adhere to their concerns. Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development spokesperson, Reggie Ngcobo says, “We can confirm that some of our employees this [Monday] morning protested outside our offices. They complained about the manner in which the offices are decontaminated for COVID-19.” Meanwhile, South Africa has recorded a further 7 657 COVID-19 infections in the last 24-hour cycle. This brings the accumulative number of cases to 1 747 082. 59 new COVID-19-related deaths have also been recorded, taking the national death toll to 57 765.
