KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says the province’s COVID 19 infection rate has started going up steeply. Zikalala was briefing the media on the latest statistics and vaccination progress in the province. He says the province is currently recording about 500 new infections a day as opposed to an average of 130 daily infections a month ago. “Our own figures in the province are still fluctuating and do not show that we have peaked yet. There are however wrong signs of what appears to be a sustained increase in the infection rate. About a month ago, KZN was registering an average of 130 to 150 new infections. But over the past two weeks, we have been recording more than 500 new cases each day with only a few exceptions where the numbers would be around 400.” Meanwhile, Zikalala has urged people who will be visiting the province during the winter holidays to ensure that they adhere to COVID-19 regulations. Zikalala has warned that those who violate regulations will face the full might of the law. He says the province is prepared for any major resurgence of cases. “We are concerned with the upcoming winter school break due to the fact that our second wave happened during the holiday season, as many people would travel to KwaZulu-Natal for the holidays.  We urge everyone to understand that we should not compromise on compliance with COVID-19 protocols. We re-iterate that no events should violate the level 3 lockdown regulations. The province is nevertheless prepared for any resurgence of cases in terms of bed availability and oxygen capacity.” The full media briefing by the KZN Premier is in the video below:
