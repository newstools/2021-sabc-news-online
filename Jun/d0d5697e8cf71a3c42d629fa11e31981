The City of Tshwane has received an unqualified audit for the 2019/20 financial year. Spokesperson for the Tshwane Executive Mayor, Sipho Stuurman, says they are pleased with the finding. “The City of Tshwane respects the independence of the Office of the Auditor-General and welcomes the unqualified opinion. Providing stringent financial management and oversight is one of our core deliverables as this administration since our return in October 2020. It is, however, important to note that the City still faces serious financial health challenges resulting from the significant deficit we inherited from the eight-month tenure of the illegal administrators,” says Stuurman. The unqualified opinion means that the financial statements present fairly in all material respects, the financial position, its financial performance and cash flows for the year under review. The period was before the capital city was placed under administration in March 2020.
