The appeal by the Ebuhleni faction over the leadership succession of the Nazareth Baptist Church or Shembe Church has been dismissed with costs in the Constitutional Court. The faction is led by the late leader Vimbeni Shembe’s son, Mduduzi. The Constitutional Court delivered its judgment virtually on Tuesday. The Ebuhleni faction approached the Constitutional Court after the Supreme Court of Appeal in 2019 upheld a KwaZulu-Natal High Court ruling that the succession would be subject to the church’s constitution. This means that Vimbeni Shembe’s cousin, Vela, will be the rightful leader of the church. More on the ruling in the video below:
