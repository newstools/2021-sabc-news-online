The government of eSwatini has dismissed reports that King Mswati the third has fled the country. Eswatini Acting Prime Minister, Themba Masuku, has addressed the media. He says the government is applying interventions to resolve the situation in the country, where pro-democracy protests have been taking place for the last five days. “Following the false media reports circulating, I would like to take this opportunity to assure eMaSwati and the international community that His Majesty, King Mswati III is in the country and continues to lead in working with the government to advance the kingdom’s goals. Government will update the nation on the interventions on the current situation as the day progresses. In the meantime, we appeal for calm, restraint, and peace for all eMaSwati,” says Masuku. Developments in eSwatini: The people of Eswatini want the country to change from Tinkhundla system and adopt a democratic one. Earlier this week, the Swaziland National Association of Teachers (SNAT)  which has been at the forefront of the protests, slammed the government for allegedly stifling the voice of the nation. It accused the government of having stopped the delivery of petitions at the Tinkhundla centres, which call for democratic reforms. The government has appealed to communities within the Kingdom to remain calm.
