The 39-year-old man, who allegedly murdered Anele Bhengu, is expected to appear before the uMbumbulu Magistrate’s Court, south of Durban, on Monday. KwaZulu-Natal police arrested the man last week after tracking the suspect down in Port Shepstone. Bhengu’s body was discovered a short distance from the home of a friend she had been visiting. Her family is demanding justice. They believe she was killed because she was lesbian. Bhengu’s murder has yet again raised the issue of violence against LGBTQI+ people in the province. In April, Sphamandla Khoza was stabbed to death near his Ntuzuma home. Last year, well known LGBTQI+ activist Lindokuhle Cele was stabbed to death at a butchery in uMlazi. Bhengu’s murder brings the killing of LGBTQI+ community members under the spotlight:  PIC CREDIT: Supplied: #sabcnews #sabckzn The man accused of killing openly Lesbian woman Anele Bhengu is expected to appear before the Mbumbulu magistrate court south of Durban.
