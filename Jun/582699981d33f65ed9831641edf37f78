COVID-19 infections continue to wreak havoc at Northern Cape schools. The provincial Education Department has for the fourth consecutive week recorded an increase in coronavirus infections at schools. Last week, over  300 COVID-19 cases were recorded. Those infected include learners, teachers and support staff. Provincial education department spokesperson Geoffrey Van Der Merwe says some of the schools which were closed, will reopen on Monday. “In total, we recorded 348 positive COVID-19 cases during last week, which includes 52 educators, 276 learners and 20 support staff at schools. This is evidence that our schools are mirrors of the rising infection rate in our communities. Parents must ensure that they limit the movement and social interaction of their children in and around their communities. Currently, we still have 11 schools closed in the Northern Cape due to COVID-19 infections. Of these schools, nine are scheduled to reopen on Monday, 7 June 2021.” The country has also recorded 97 new COVID-19 related fatalities on Saturday, which brings the total number of deaths to 56 929.
