Deputy President David Mabuza has urged military veterans across the political divide, to organise themselves in one group for government to adequately support them. Military veterans often complain that they are not getting housing, health services and other things from government equally. In the video below the SABC speaks to a member of the then Venda Defence Force:  Addressing a group of military veterans in Limpopo from the old South African Defence Force (SADF), Venda Defence Force (VDF) and ANC’s Mkonto we Sizwe (MKVA), Azanian Peoples’ Liberation Army (APLA) and the Azanian Peoples’ National Army (AZANLA) and others, Mabuza says government is worried that military veterans fight amongst themselves. He says military veterans from former liberations parties are still battling with verifications to check who was in the trenches whereas the situation of others from the SADF and VDF is better. “You must try and organise yourselves, we don’t want these groupings amongst yourselves because we don’t understand why you are fighting amongst yourselves. You are a community that is getting smaller and smaller.” “You are a community that is ageing. So why would old people fight among themselves? MKVA and military council you must go and solve your issues with immediate effect. It is not good for this community,” adds Mabuza.
