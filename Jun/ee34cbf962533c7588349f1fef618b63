The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has called on the public to continue putting pressure on the South African and the United Arab Emirates governments to ensure the speedy return of the controversial Gupta family. Processes are underway to extradite Gupta family members to South Africa over allegations of state capture. The UAE embassy has confirmed that the country has ratified an extradition treaty with South Africa which will ensure that the Guptas are brought back. Director of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, Neeshan Bolton, says the organisation is due to stage a picket outside the embassy in Pretoria on Thursday. “We are continuing with the picket today because the Guptas are not yet back from the UAE. Two things need to happen: 1. The Guptas need to be served with summonses. They also need to be prevented from fleeing the country itself. 2. Cooperating with the SA government, they need to make arrangements to transport them back to the country and until that time, there is a need for pressure on both the UAE and the SA government to ensure this family is brought back to come and account for all the destruction that they have caused in this country.” Interpol arrest warrant for Guptas:
