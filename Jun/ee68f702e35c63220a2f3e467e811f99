Investors retrenched and avoided major risks across multiple markets on Tuesday as markets awaited fresh guidance from the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday. Wall Street took a step back on Tuesday, with all three major indices dropping after two posted record highs on Monday. US Treasuries held steady, as did the US dollar, with little activity ahead of the Fed policy statement. The continued relaxation of pandemic restrictions helped drive oil prices higher on growing demand as vaccinated people begin to travel more freely. Investors appeared reluctant to take on major new risks following a pair of disappointing economic data reports on Tuesday morning. One found retail sales shrinking more than expected in May, as consumers shifted their spending to service industries as pandemic restrictions ease. The second saw producers reporting higher price increases as they scramble to keep up with growing demand, exacerbating concerns about inflation. “Supply constraints and surging demand seem to weigh heavy on companies. So while PPI is signaling that inflation is creeping up, keep in mind there are unique circumstances related to our economic comeback that are putting pressure on these numbers,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial. “Since hitting its new high yesterday, the market was in a bit of a holding pattern today with the Fed decision on deck tomorrow.” The readings loomed large ahead of the Wednesday statement. The central bank is not expected to announce any plans to ease back on its bond purchases until August, but investors are looking for any indication the Fed has begun discussing such an exit. Fed officials have said they view current price increases as transitory while the economy recovers. Nearly 60% of economists in a Reuters poll expect a taper announcement will come in the next quarter, despite a patchy recovery in the job market.
