The Constitutional Court will hand down judgment on the contempt case against former President Jacob Zuma on Tuesday morning. The Chair of the State Capture Commission, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has asked the apex court to declare Zuma in contempt of court. He also wanted him sentenced to two years in prison for defying summonses for him to testify before the commission. Former President Zuma has been steadfast on his conviction that the judiciary is biased against him following an earlier ruling by the Constitutional Court that he should appear before the State Capture Commission. The case against Jacob Zuma’s case resumes on Tuesday:  The commission’s lawyer Advocate Thembeka Ngcukaitobi has said Zuma deserves a jail term. South Africa is waiting with bated breath to see if indeed the former President will be sent to jail after 10am on Tuesday morning.
