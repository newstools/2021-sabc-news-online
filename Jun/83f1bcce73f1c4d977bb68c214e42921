Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande says universities across the country will not shut down during lockdown Alert Level 4, however, all classes will move online. Nzimande was briefing the media on measures to ensure compliance with regulations in the tertiary education sector. As the Delta variant of COVID-19 ravages across the country, Nzimande says their main concern is the safety of staff and students. “Institutions are expected to ensure their COVID-19 task teams are functional and active during this period. In terms of Level 4 lockdown, our universities do not officially close but all face-to-face teaching and examinations must halt for the next weeks. Learning will shift exclusively to online. Residents will remain open as it is not safe for students to travel back home,” says Nzimande.

The variant, which was first detected in India is currently dominating the infection rate in Gauteng, according to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. Gauteng has recorded almost 57% of the 19 506 new cases reported in the past 24-hours.
