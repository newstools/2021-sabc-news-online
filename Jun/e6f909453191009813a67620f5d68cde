The Traditional Prime Minister of the Zulu nation, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, says battle lines are drawn in the royal family about who should succeed the late King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu. Buthelezi was addressing the media at KwaNongoma in northern KwaZulu-Natal. He says members of the royal family who don’t support King Misuzulu KaZwelithini have written a letter to the Premier, asking that the same security afforded to the King be granted to Prince Simakade Zulu. “It appears that the battle lines in this conflict have been drawn, as far as I am concerned. We felt therefore that the nation should be informed so that they might judge for themselves who is right and who is wrong in this conflict,” says Prince Buthelezi. Buthelezi announced King Misuzulu KaZweltihini as the successor in May, based on the last will and testament of the regent, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu. At the beginning of the month it became apparent that other members of the royal family were nominating Prince Simakade for the throne. Buthelezi says he is happy that the differences have not led to conflict. “The matter is of such a serious nature that, had we not achieved this stage in our country of constitutional development, it is clear there would be war now,” added Buthelezi.
