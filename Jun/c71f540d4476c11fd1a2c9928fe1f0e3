MEC Simelane-Zulu will start at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium, where the outer precinct has been acting as a walk-in site for the last three weeks. South Africa has administered over 1.3 million vaccines so far. The campaign comes as concerns of a third wave grow with several provinces already feeling its impact. KZN Premier Coronavirus Council briefing KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala said, during the provincial Coronavirus Command Council media briefing on Sunday, that the number of reported COVID-19 infections is increasing in the province.  Zikalala says the province is not yet in the third wave but the Amajuba district has recorded the highest number of infections. Ethekwini has also recorded the highest number of cases, although it has not reached the alert level, it continues to contribute the highest percentage of deaths, added Zikalala. “The province of KwaZulu-Natal continues to observe an increase in the number of new cases recorded weekly and that is very concerning the overall percentage change in the number of new cases between week 21 and week 22 was 24 percent the actual number of new cases were 726 for week 21 and 900 for week 22 respectively. Amajuba district is the only district that has reached the alert line.” Zikalala also expressed concern about the increasing number of COVID-19 cases at some schools in the province. “We are also concerned by a few schools which have reported a high number of infections within a space of a few days. For example, on Friday the 4th of June one school under uMzinyathi reported 16 positive cases of learners another school under the uThukela district reported 15 positive cases of learners. The Department of Education will continue to implement COVID- 19 protocol and to provide necessary PPEs.” Zikalala says over 300 000 people have been vaccinated in the province thus far. Zikalala also says 21 new sites will be open this week to accommodate the vaccination of teachers. Zikalala’s media briefing:
