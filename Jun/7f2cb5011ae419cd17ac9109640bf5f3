A South African soldier serving in the United Nations (UN) Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been killed. The UN has confirmed a report by News24 that a soldier was killed while taking part in an operation in Kilya, in the eastern DRC’s North Kivu province. The UN Mission in the DRC said it was saddened to report that a soldier from South Africa was killed in an incident caused by the incorrect handling of his weapon by another UN soldier. They offered their condolences to the family of the deceased and the Government of South Africa. A News24 report quotes South African National Defence Force (SANDF) Spokesperson, Brigadier Mafi Mgobozi, who says the soldier was shot dead in a friendly fire incident on Thursday morning and that a board of inquiry would be convened to investigate the matter. An SANDF infantry battalion of over 1000 soldiers is currently deployed to the UN peacekeeping mission as part of its offensive Force Intervention Brigade. The identity of the deceased soldier will be released only once the family and next of kin have been informed.
