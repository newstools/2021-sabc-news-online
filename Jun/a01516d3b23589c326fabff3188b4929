The Group of Seven (G7) countries have agreed to step up their production and deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines around the world, European Union Council President Charles Michel said on Sunday. “The priority was to ensure we can meet the demand for vaccines, and here the EU has taken the leadership. Partners have now joined us to accelerate production and delivery of vaccines worldwide,” Michel, who chairs summits of EU leaders, said in a video message on Twitter. A draft of the G7 communique on Sunday said the group of countries will provide 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses over the next year and work with the private sector, the G20 and other countries to increase the contribution over months to come. “The G7 ends today. We spent three days at work trying to align the positions of the major democracies in the world. The priority was of course to ensure we can meet the demand for vaccines, and here the EU has taken the leadership. Partners have now joined us to accelerate production and delivery of vaccines worldwide,” added Michel Michel also spoke about Europe’s relationship with Africa. “And finally, a point that is particularly close to my heart, this commitment to Africa. For some years now, some of us in Europe have been convinced that this commitment to Africa should be at the heart of the future of international relations. We have been able to align and bring together, unify European positions on this subject more and more recently. We can see that here too, we were able to convince our partners to mobilize more resources to develop a win-win strategy for Africa and for Europe.”
