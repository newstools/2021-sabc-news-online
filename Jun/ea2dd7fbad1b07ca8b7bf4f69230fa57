The G7 Summit will wrap up on Sunday with climate change on the agenda. On Saturday, President Cyril Ramaphosa joined discussions on reviving the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic response has been high on the agenda at the summit. The President was welcomed by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the beach of Carbis Bay. He also used the opportunity to canvas support for the proposal on waiving intellectual property on COVID-19 products. Ramaphosa was the only African leader invited to this year’s summit. I welcome the support of US President @JoeBiden for a #TRIPSwaiver to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are urging leaders at the #G7 Summit to support a time-bound and limited waiver to expand the global supply of COVID-19 vaccines & medicinces. #G7UK #BetterAfricaBetterWorld pic.twitter.com/mb8VVmvvz5 — Cyril Ramaphosa  #StaySafe (@CyrilRamaphosa) June 12, 2021
