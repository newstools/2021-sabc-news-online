They are indirectly responsible for illegal activities that are claiming the lives of desperate miners who were led to death by ruthless crime syndicates. We urge the police to investigate whether human trafficking is not involved in these atrocious activities. No stone must be left unturned, justice for victims must be served without compromise,” explains Sebego. 20 bodies of illegal miners found in Orkney:  Meanwhile, Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe has raised concerns about the impact of illegal mining in communities. Mantashe says it is an attack on the country’s economy and must be dealt with decisively. The minister says his department will meet with relevant stakeholders, including the office of the Minister for Police to provide backup to private security in areas where illegal activities are prevalent.
