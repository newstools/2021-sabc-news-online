Four people have died in a collision between two cars and a truck on the R75 between Graaff-Reinet and Jansenville in the Eastern Cape. Provincial transport department spokesperson Unathi Binqose says the crash happened yesterday. He says four occupants of one of the cars died on the scene. “There was another car involved, it was also a sedan, and, thankfully, the occupants of that sedan, as well as the articulated truck, escaped with their lives. It is a bad accident, one that we believe could have been avoided. The MEC for Transport in the Eastern Cape Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe is continuously calling on motorists to exercise caution on the road and, most importantly, be patient at all times to avoid avoidable accidents like head-on collisions.”
