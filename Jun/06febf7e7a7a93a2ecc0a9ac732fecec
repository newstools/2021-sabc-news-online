North West police are still looking for suspects following the killing of three people who are believed to be members of a long-distance taxi association operating between North West and the Eastern Cape. The people were shot and killed next to a garage in Orkney in the North West last Wednesday. Three counts of murder and six of attempted murder are being investigated. Members of the police who were on duty at the Police Community Service Centre heard gunshots not far from the police station. Later, a man armed with a pistol and bleeding came to the police station. Police say a white Ford Ranger with about three occupants allegedly entered the garage and stopped next to the Toyota Fortuner with four occupants that were parked nearby. The suspects allegedly fired shots towards the Fortuner, resulting in fatally wounding three of the occupants, while the fourth victim managed to flee. Five bystanders were also injured in the process.
