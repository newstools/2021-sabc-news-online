Six SANDF soldiers who were arrested for alleged corruption in three provinces are expected to make their first court appearance at the Musina Magistrateâ€™s Court in Limpopo. They were arrested by the Hawks on Tuesday. The soldiers were allegedly conniving with an international car smuggling syndicate to smuggle out vehicles from South Africa to Zimbabwe during 2017 and 2019 when they had been deployed around the Beit Bridge border post outside Musina. The Hawks arrested the suspects in the North West, Free State and Northern Cape provinces. Police say the soldiers were allegedly charging R15 000 per vehicle to assist the syndicate to move it across the Limpopo river. Meanwhile, two SANDF soldiers were also arrested on the N1 outside Beit Bridge for allegedly transporting illicit cigarettes in an army vehicle over the weekend. They will appear tomorrow at the same court for bail application.
