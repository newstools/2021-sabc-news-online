The Northern Cape Department of Education says the current wave of the virus is seriously affecting schools across the province. Two schools in the province remain closed due to COVID-19 infections. The department says if the situation does not improve, they will request the Minister for a deviation, to allow for more time before schools in the province return to normal lessons. In May, Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga, announced that all South African primary schools and schools for learners with special needs, will return to daily attendance from July the 26th. “The MEC already indicated that the department will assess the situation at that given time, engaging with school governing bodies and management teams to assess the situation. Ultimately that will determine the way forward in that regard. If needs be, the MEC did indicate that he will write the letter to the minister requesting for deviation,” says Geoffrey Van Der Merwe, Provincial Department Spokesperson.
