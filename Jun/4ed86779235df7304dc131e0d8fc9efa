The trial against a man accused of killing Capricorn TVET college student, Precious Ramabulana, has been postponed to Wednesday, at the Limpopo High Court. Aubrey Manaka (28) allegedly sexually assaulted 21-year-old Precious Ramabulana and later stabbed her 52 times in 2020. He was unavailable at Court on Monday as he and other prisoners are in quarantine. The Modimolle prison, where he is kept, has reported COVID-19 cases. Manaka is also on trial for another count of rape for allegedly raping a five-year-old girl in 2014. Provincial Spokesperson of the National Prosecuting Authority, Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, says the matter will resume on Wednesday. “Due to unavailability of the accused person, Aubrey Manaka, we could not proceed with the matter today in the Polokwane High Court because the accused person is on quarantine, we will come back in court and proceed with the trial on 9 June 2021 in Polokwane High Court.” In the video below, Manaka pleads not guilty:  Meanwhile, the bail application of a 42-year-old mother and two Bangladesh nationals who are accused of sexual exploitation and rape has been postponed to the 11th of June at the Keiskammahoek Magistrates Court in the Eastern Cape. It’s alleged that the mother sold her 13-year daughter and her 16-year-old niece off to the men in exchange for drugs and alcohol. They were arrested last month following an investigation by the Hawks. Children’s rights activist, Petros Majola has called on the court to show no mercy to the accused. “I am so disappointed we shouldn’t be getting these cases because this one amounts to trafficking persons because these kids we sold in exchange for cash now I want to appeal to the government of the Eastern Cape and that of South Africa to incorporate programs of trafficking persons into gender-based violence programs so that we make a very strong voice.”
