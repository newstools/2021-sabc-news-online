Police responded to the scene and found one person dead and five patrol cars from a taxi association damaged. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela says the nine suspects have been taken into custody. Makhubela says, “Upon searching the suspects’ car, police recovered three firearms which will be taken for ballistic testing to establish whether or not they may have been used in the commission of other crimes.” “The suspects will be charged with murder and possession of unlicensed firearms.
