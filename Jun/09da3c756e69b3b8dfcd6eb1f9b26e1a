The COVID-19 pandemic has made the City of Tshwane think creatively to help vaccinate teachers in the capital. The City has deployed its disaster management bus to serve as a mobile vaccination site for educators. Tshwane has been identified by the Gauteng Command Council as the city with the third most COVID-19 infections in the province.

Standing under big trees in Sunnyside the bus offers vaccination access to teachers who won’t be able to go to other sites. Sipho Stuurman, Spokesperson for Executive Mayor of the City of Tshwane, says the mobile site will help to accelerate teacher vaccines. “The City has successfully implemented an additional measure to enhance teacher vaccinations. The City has deployed its disaster management bus to serve as a mobile vaccination site for educators. Before the mobile vaccination site was activated, our teams thoroughly inspected the bus and quality approved it.” Currently, the bus is stationed at Liana Hof Teachers centre in Sunnyside. The site was identified by the Gauteng Department of Education as acceptable and accessible for teachers in the City. “The bus is compliant with all necessary requirements, including having air conditioning, fridges, oxygen supply on-board as well as a wheelchair lift to ensure accessibility for the disabled. The mobile vaccination bus started its work this past Wednesday during the launch of the educators’ vaccine programme. A total of 120 vaccines were administered on the first day alone.” Stuurman says if the need arises, the mobile vaccination unit can be moved to another site.
