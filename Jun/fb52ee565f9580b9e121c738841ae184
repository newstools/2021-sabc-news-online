A 24-year-old woman is expected to appear before the Middelburg Magistrate’s Court in Mpumalanga on Monday morning for the alleged murder of her three-month-old baby. Mpumalanga police say the incident happened over the weekend at Avontuur near Middelburg. Mpumalanga Police Spokesperson Leonard Hlathi says the woman and her daughter had visited the baby’s father and upon arrival the man refused to let them into the house. The suspect then threatened to kill their baby if he did not open the door. Hlathi says the suspect threw the baby on the ground and she was certified dead by paramedics upon arrival.
