The Gauteng Traffic Police are still searching for two vehicle spiking suspects after they fled on Friday night during a shootout in Pretoria, during which one suspect was killed. Gauteng Traffic spokesperson Sello Maremane says officers were placed strategically next to the N1 highway, close to the Stormvoël offramp on Friday night when the suspects struck. An Iveco minibus was spiked, and while the suspects were robbing the occupants, police intervened and attempted to arrest the robbers. Vehicle spiking incidents continue unabated despite police visibility:  Maremane says the suspects opened fire without uttering any words and the police retaliated, killing one suspect while the other two fled. He says a manhunt has been launched to find the two suspects that escaped on Friday night. The Gauteng Traffic spokesperson says they will continue to prioritise incidents of car spiking on the roads in the province. Incidents of vehicle spiking have increased in the past two months that Gauteng Traffic issued a warning.  Premier @David_Makhura – The Highway Patrol vehicles you donated to the @SAPoliceService a few months ago should be used along the affected routes immediately! @GP_CommSafety https://t.co/seMydEpiEZ — Yusuf Abramjee (@Abramjee) June 6, 2021
