The Gauteng Provincial Health Department says there is a growing number of school children testing positive, with over one thousand positive cases reported in public schools. The most recent school to be closed in the province is King Edward VII, after over 30 pupils and three teachers tested positive for COVID-19. Last month, the national Department of Education suspended all contact sport following an increase in sporting-related infections.  Gauteng Education spokesperson, Steve Mabona says: “We are working very closely with the Gauteng Provincial Health Department. They give guidance on what is it we need to do and when to do it. When we closed all those schools, we were advised to do so. Safety of all our learners is top priority. So, we did the right thing.”
