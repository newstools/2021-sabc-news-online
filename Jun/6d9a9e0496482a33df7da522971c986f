An Eastern Cape school principal who coerced a learner to search for his cell phone in a pit toilet has been fired. Earlier this year, Lubeko Mgandela from Luthuthu Junior Secondary school in Ugie in the Eastern Cape, offered an 11-year -old learner R200 to climb into the toilet to retrieve his cell phone. Eastern Cape Provincial Education Department spokesperson Vuyiseka Mboxela says MEC Fundile Gade accepted the disciplinary committee’s decision. “The MEC received the verdict of the DC. The disciplinary process of the department found the principal liable for cohesion of the learner into getting inside the pit toilet to fetch the phone. The DC concluded that indeed he is guilty and he was therefore dismissed. The MEC accepted that decision.” Pupil made to retrieve phone from pit toilet:  Uproar over cell phone incident involving a pupil and school principal:
