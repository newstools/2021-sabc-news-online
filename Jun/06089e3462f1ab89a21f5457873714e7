The Eastern Cape government is commemorating the Mpondo Revolt Massacre at Ngquza Hill in Flagstaff. Eleven people were gunned down whilst 58 others were left injured on this day in 1960. The Mpondo people were attending a meeting at the hill when policemen fired shots at the crowd. Twenty-three people were arrested for participating in uprisings and executed in Pretoria in 1964. The commemoration is meant to acknowledge the role played by the AmaMpondo people in the struggle for freedom and liberation. Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane, government officials and traditional leaders will attend the launch of an exhibition at the Ngquza Hill museum. Among those who are expected to speak at the commemoration are Professor Somadoda Fikeni and AmaMpondo King Zanozuko Sigcau.
