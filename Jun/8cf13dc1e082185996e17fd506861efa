The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) has instituted an internal investigation into the conduct of two officers who harassed a street vendor in Douglasdale last week. In a video that has since gone viral on social media, the female vendor who was selling dog baskets on the side of the road is being forced into the JMPD vehicle after her merchandise was confiscated. Community members have since created an uproar on social media saying the manner in which she was treated was inhumane and barbaric. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar says, “There is an internal investigation after an incident occurred outside Republic Park, Douglasdale, a few days ago, following a scene on social media where a female and male officer are seen in a scuffle with a female trader who was selling dog baskets at a park…” “However, the uploading and enforcing of city by-laws are necessary so that the sidewalks of the city are not obstructed for pedestrians to not walk in the way of oncoming traffic,” added Minnaar.
