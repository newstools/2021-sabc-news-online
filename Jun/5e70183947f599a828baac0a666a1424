Chinese social media platform, WeChat, has published a list of activities and “violations” it is banning in a bid to clean up its live streaming service, including nose-picking and spanking games. WeChat is used by around one billion people for everything from sending instant messages to ordering pizzas. Its popular “Channels” feature allows users to make and follow live broadcasts. China closely regulates its internet and has been increasingly clamping down on content that is politically or socially sensitive. Deliberately showing tattoos, using bedsheets as props and women broadcasting while wearing only underwear or a bikini, or being wrapped in a bath towel, were also listed as violations.
