Free State Health MEC Montseng Tsiu has again urged people over the age of 60 to come forward and get vaccinated against COVID-19 in the province. Tsiu embarked on a campaign to encourage the elderly to register to vaccinate at Maokeng Mall in Kroonstad on Saturday. The provincial Department of Health says it is concerned about the drop in the numbers of people registering in the Free State to get vaccinated. The province has not reached half of its target of vaccinating of 1.9  million people over the age of 60 by the end of July. Since the beginning of the Phase 2 rollout almost a month ago, the province has vaccinated only 94 000 people. Tsiu says daily infections in the province are still on the rise. She says more nurses have been hired and trained to vaccinate at vaccination sites around the province. “At least we said our target is to vaccinate for each vaccine site they must not do less than 2000 a day, but we find that now we have even lower that 500. So there was a time we were able to do more than a thousand even 2000. we still believe there are still many people who have not come. We have made sure that they don’t sit for a very long time,” says Tsiu.
