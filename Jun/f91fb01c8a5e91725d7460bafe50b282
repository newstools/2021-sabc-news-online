The National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) says South Africa has technically entered the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic because the seven-day moving average of cases exceeds the threshold set by the Health Department. The NICD has confirmed that 9 149 new cases of the coronavirus have occurred in the latest reporting period.  It says the case positivity rate stands at 15.7% – which is more than three times what is considered acceptable. Health Director-General, Sandile Buthelezi, says this is the highest number since mid-January. This brings the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases to 1 722 086.  Health expert, Professor Salim Abdool Karim says the real current rate of infections is probably twice what is being reported. He says the latest data is actually a reflection of what happened well over a week ago. Prof Karim says it’s up to ordinary people to assist in slowing the spread of the coronavirus by wearing masks, washing hands and practicing social distancing. People are also urged to avoid poorly ventilated and crowded places. Prof. Salim Abdool Karim reflects on increasing COVID-19 cases:  The department of Health has expressed grave concern about the large jump in the number of infections countrywide, especially since five provinces are already in the third wave of the pandemic. Buthelezi says from the way things are going, it is certain that the whole country would soon be in the third wave. Technical third wave According to a statement released by the ministry today, South Africa has technically entered the third wave today as the national 7-day moving average incidence (5 959 cases) now exceeds the new wave threshold as defined by the Ministerial Advisory Committee. The MAC advisory defined the new wave 7-day moving average threshold as 30% of the peak incidence of the previous wave.   The majority of new cases registered on Thursday are from the Gauteng province (61%), followed by the Western Cape (10%) province. Both the Free State and North West provinces accounted for 6%.
