All eyes will be on the Gauteng Command Council briefing in Johannesburg on Thursday as they zoom in on the COVID-19 flash points in the economic hub of the country, including the worsening situation at hospitals.  Gauteng has registered a record 10 806 new infections in a 24 hour period. Gauteng remains the province worst affected by the third wave â€“ accounting for around two thirds of new infections.  For more than a week now, Premier David Makhura, has been calling for tougher lockdown measures in the province. Public and private hospitals are already operating beyond capacity and staff shortages are evident.
