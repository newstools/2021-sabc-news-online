The Nelson Mandela University in Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape says their existing plans for the continuation of the academic programme, predominantly online, remain in place. This follows the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa that all in-person classes and experimental learning activities should end on Wednesday under Level 4 of the lockdown. The video below is President Ramaphosa’s address:  University spokesperson Zandile Mbabela says new developments will be properly communicated with students and staff. “Throughout the pandemic, the Nelson Mandela University has planned its own response in relation to both operations and learning and teaching in such a way that it advances the academic programme while ensuring as far as possible the utmost safety and well being of its staff and students.” “As indicated by the president on Sunday night, universities will soon receive information and further guidance from the Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister Blade Nzimande. [University] staff, students and all the stakeholders are advised to keep an eye out on the internal communication channels as well as university’s website and official social media platforms,” says Mbabela.
