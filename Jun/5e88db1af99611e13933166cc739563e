The fraud case against Northern Cape Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Aubrey Baartman, and two others has been postponed to September. Baartman and his co-accused are facing fraud charges relating to a 2013 tender for paving stones and curbs worth more than R79 million. He was the Nama Khoi Municipal Manager when procurement processes were allegedly flouted with the awarding of the three-year tender to his two co-accused. Northern Cape Hawks Spokesperson, Nomthandazo Mnisi, says: “It is alleged that the couple were the directors of a construction company that was selected as a successful bidder by the Nama Khoi Municipality in Springbok in 2013.” “Furthermore, it is alleged that the company did not meet the necessary requirements and the procurement process was allegedly flouted. The matter was reported to the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation team which culminated to them facing a charge of fraud along with a juristic person,” explains Mnisi.
