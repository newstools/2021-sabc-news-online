Health workers in Gauteng are under heavy pressure as COVID-19 patients fill available hospital beds. SANDF medics have been enlisted to assist but trade unions say it’s not enough to deal with the staff shortages at health facilities. Gauteng accounts for around two thirds of new coronavirus cases in the country. Close to 11 500 people have been hospitalised. 36-year old nurse, Rich Sicina, at the Thelle Mogoerane Hospital, says two wards have been converted for COVID-19 patients: “Patients under investigation are flooding casualty, more patients are being admitted it’s totally overwhelming. The way we are moving eventually this whole hospital will be turned into a COVID-19 facility.”
