The High Court in Polokwane, Limpopo, will on Tuesday hear an application by Modikwa platinum mine outside Burgersfort to stop mining by another company, Nkwe platinum mine. Modikwa platinum mine wants its competitor to stop mining at Maandagshoek arguing that it holds the mining rights in the area. It wants Nkwe to conduct its mining operations at Ga Ratau and Leolo village where it has rights. Nkwe Platinum mine started fencing an area at Mandagshoek where it will keep its mining equipment. The Mandagshoek land claimants are in support of Modikwa platinum mine. Meanwhile, Nkwe Platinum mine has announced that it has applied for business rescue due to uncertainty and has decided to suspend mining operations at Ga-Ratau. In a statement sent to the SABC, Nkwe Platinum Mine says its relationship with its business partner Blue Nightingale has deteriorated significantly.
