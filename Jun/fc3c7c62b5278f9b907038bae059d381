There are growing concerns as more people get arrested for violating the country’s COVID-19 regulations. It means many will end up with a criminal record. Experts say this could have long-term consequences not only for the affected individuals but for the economy as well. Responding to a Parliamentary question from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in April, Police Minister Bheki Cele divulged that over 400 000  people had been arrested for breaking COVID-19 regulations since the beginning of the national lockdown in March last year. As the COVID-19 restrictions and their enforcement is being tightened again amid the ongoing third wave of infections, experts say the growing number of arrests is worrying.

Legal Expert from Adams and Adams Attorneys Mthokozisi Maphumulo says, “Most of those who are arrested are found breaking regulations on gatherings and the night-time curfews. Normally, they are let go after paying an admission of guilt fine. The problem is, by so doing, the person ends up with a criminal record.” More people violating lockdown regulations:  With the COVID-19 pandemic still having no end in sight, there’s now a distinct possibility that many people will end up with criminal records as time goes on. President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced that the government is considering imposing tighter lockdown measures, especially in Gauteng, as the number of infections continue to rise unabated. With that will come stricter enforcement, which means more arrests and more people ending up with criminal records.
