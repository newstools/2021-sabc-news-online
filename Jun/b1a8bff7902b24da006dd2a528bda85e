President Cyril Ramaphosa says Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries are prepared to assist Mozambique to fight the insurgency that has destabilised the north of that country. He says leaders of the region are dealing with the situation because if they don’t, the conflict could spill over into their own countries. Ramaphosa says the SADC Troika has sent technical experts to the troubled Cabo Delgado province to assess Mozambique’s needs in the area. Ramaphosa, however, would not say what steps are going to be taken. “You don’t want to be involved in a war situation and tell your adversary that we are coming, get ready for us. You don’t want to do that. I know that the media is interested. When are you going to send boots on the ground? When are you flying over? I am afraid you just have to bear with us. That’s the type of sensitive information that we’ll have to keep quiet about.” Outcomes of Extraordinary Double Troika SADC Summit on Mozambique:  The insurgency broke out in Mozambique’s northeast in 2017 and the rebels have stepped up attacks in the past year. A report by rating agency S&P Global said militant attacks in Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province pose a “significant threat” to production facilities associated with one the biggest natural gas discoveries in the world. In March, rebels assaulted the coastal town of Palma, near natural gas projects worth $60 billion that is meant to transform Mozambique’s economy. Dozens of people were killed. At least 12 South African citizens are believed to be part of the Isis-linked group that has attacked the town of Palma. This has raised concerns among South African security experts, with many of them calling for SADC to intervene and counter the possibility of any terror attacks on South Africa. At least one South African, Adrian Nel, has been killed in the insurgent attack on Palma. Adrian Nel killed during an attack in Mozambique, mother shares account:
