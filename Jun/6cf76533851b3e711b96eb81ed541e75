Aubrey Manaka has pleaded guilty to the rape and murder of Capricorn TVET College student Precious Ramabulana at the Limpopo High Court.  Manaka also pleaded guilty to charges of robbery and housebreaking. His confession statement was presented in court today where his trial is under way. Manaka confessed that he noticed Ramabulana a day before he stabbed her with a knife inside her off-campus room. He had been visiting his aunt at Mokomene village. In his statement, he also claims that he had initially planned to romantically propose to her. Ramabulana’s aunt, Mavis Silothimela says while they welcome the outcomes, they are still heartbroken. “I feel a little bit better but we are still in pain as a family, because it can’t bring us our child anymore, seriously it was painful because it takes long for justice to be done. But now I can feel a little bit better, we will see tomorrow, I don’t have any words, thank you.” Aubrey Manaka pleads guilty to killing Precious Ramabulana:
