The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape is moving to quell tensions at the branch level as there have been violent incidents already linked to branch meetings. The branch general meetings are sitting to nominate ward candidates for the local government elections. Incidents have already been recorded in the Amathole, Alfred Nzo, and Buffalo City regions. Momentum is building for the upcoming local government elections and political parties are getting their house in order to elect ward candidates. In the Eastern Cape, the ANC is already dealing with challenges as some meetings have erupted in violence. Just this weekend the fists flew at the branch meeting of ward 7 in Buffalo City. Nokekethi Mavuso was severely beaten during the fight. She says they are in support of a new ward candidate to replace the incumbent and that is the cause of the animosity. “It’s all about these elections, the reason we were beaten is that we wanted another councillor who will serve us, we got beaten and tensions are high and we are not happy.” The group supporting the incumbent in Ward 7 is yet to respond to the allegations. Party provincial spokesperson Loyiso Magqashela says they will take disciplinary actions against those who instigate violence in these meetings. “All the perpetrators who instigate violence and those who actually assault in those meetings must be brought into book according to the DC processes of ANC if there would any REC (Regional Executive Committee) or any leader that is part of the perpetration or frustration for such actions to an extent of them turning violent those ones must be summoned.” The party is also deploying members of its PEC to oversee meetings in hotspots. The police have also been roped in to maintain order.
