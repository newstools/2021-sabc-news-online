A man is expected to appear in court soon in connection with Thursday’s hostage drama in the Durban CBD. The man who is believed to be a retired security force member allegedly threatened a manager in the Government Employee Pension Fund office on the 13th floor of a building in Anton Lembede Street. A firearm was visible on the man’s body during the two-hour standoff, but according to police, the suspect did not draw the firearm. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele says the situation was defused by members of the police task force. “The police were called to the scene and the situation was defused. And the hostage was taken by the police for further interview.” Emer-G-med paramedic spokesperson Kyle van Reenen says, “To report back from the scene on Anton Lembede Street a short while ago a male suspect was escorted out of the building by members of the South African police services. Emer-G-med paramedics can confirm that there were no injuries and no fatalities were sustained. And the South African Police Services are to be commended for their swift action.” Male suspect apprehended after a hostage situation in the Durban CBD https://t.co/TYNWBBKVUX #ArriveAlive #Crime @rescuecare pic.twitter.com/itT7Z55s4p — Arrive Alive (@_ArriveAlive) June 10, 2021  Update on the Durban CBD drama: Jayed-Leigh Paulse
