The Norwood Community Policing Forum in Johannesburg is increasing its efforts to curb the consumption of fizzy drinks and codeine. The #LeanOnMe campaign is aimed at sensitising communities about the effects of codeine abuse amongst the youth:  Member of the steering committee for the campaign, Mongi Maphipha says most parents don’t even know what lean is. “One of the symptoms from lean is laziness, where somebody just doesn’t want to do anything, they just to lean on something and that’s what they want, they don’t want to do anything, it’s affecting them,’ ’says Maphipha. Maphipha added that the campaign also includes parents. “We are trying to make the parents aware of the scourge which is cough syrup addiction or misuse, so now we are basically trying to make the parents aware and the educators. Most of the children right now don’t even go to school.”
