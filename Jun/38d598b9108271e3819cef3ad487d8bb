Slovenia will allow a state of emergency declared over the COVID-19 pandemic to expire on Tuesday after eight months, lifting most remaining restrictions, the Health Ministry said. Cultural and sports events will be able to reopen at 75% capacity for people who can demonstrate they have been vaccinated, tested negative or recovered from a previous infection. Some protection measures will remain in force, such as the requirement to wear face masks indoors in public and maintain a safe distance from others, said the state secretary in the health ministry, Franc Vindisar. On Tuesday, Slovenia reported 112 new cases of COVID-19 and two deaths. Some 45% of Sloveniaâ€™s adult population has received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while 32% received two shots.
