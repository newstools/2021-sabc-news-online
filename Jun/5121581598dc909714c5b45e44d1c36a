Acting Health Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane has appealed to Gauteng residents to refrain from social gatherings to help curb the COVID-19 infections in the province. She has also urged mourners not to visit families who have bereavements, as gatherings have been proven to be super spreaders. The minister has once again expressed concerns about the rising numbers of infections in Gauteng, saying the health system in the province is under strain. Speaking during a virtual briefing, Kubayi-Ngubane says transmissions can only be stopped if the public plays its role. “We do understand and know that Gauteng is under pressure and because it is weekend, those who are going to be drinking alcohol, being irresponsible, please can you stay at home? Just for once, take a decision that I’m going stay at home. The visits to families in and out daily are also causing a problem. We are pleading with you Guatengers. We are pleading with you to really respond to our call. We can increase the restrictions, but without your response we will not be able to beat this pandemic.” Kubayi-Ngubane gives update on COVID-19:  Mogale City second most affected region With Gauteng hit hardest by the Delta variant of COVID-19, Mogale City is the second most affected region in the province.
