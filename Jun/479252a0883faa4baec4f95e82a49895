The South African Medical Association (SAMA) has called on government to enforce stricter lockdown measures saying some members of the public are not adhering to COVID-19 health protocols. South Africa is operating under lockdown level two amid the third wave of the coronavirus in parts of the country. The Health Department has recorded 67 new COVID-19 related fatalities on Friday, which brings the total number of deaths to 56 832. SAMA’s Chairperson Dr Angelique Coetzee says stricter regulations are needed to stop the spread of COVID-19. “I know I have been criticized for asking for stricter lockdowns or curfews over the weekend but the truth of the matter is that people don’t listen anymore and we need to protect the average person out there who is doing things correctly. But unfortunately, when they get into a place where other people are, in confined spaces like taxis or busses all that work where someone doesn’t wear their mask, they can get the infection.” Latest SA stats:  Meanwhile, as the COVID-19 numbers continue to rise, Health expert Professor Tulio de Oliveira warns that immuno-compromised people can produce new COVID-19 variants where the virus circulates and mutates within their bodies.
