Lesotho families will on Monday arrive in the North West to identify the 20 bodies believed to be those of illegal miners, who died underground in Orkney, just outside Klerksdorp, recently. The bodies wrapped in grain bags were discovered last week at an abandoned mine shaft. Most of the deceased are said to be Lesotho nationals. The families will be joined by North West Premier, Job Mokgoro. Before meeting with the Lesotho families, Premier Mokgoro is expected to engage with Lesothoâ€™s Consul General, Selimo Thabane at the Matlosana Local Municipality Chambers. They will then proceed to the government mortuary, where they will meet with the deceased families for identification of the bodies. It is believed the deceased died following an accident underground. Update on discovered bodies at an old unused Orkney mine:
