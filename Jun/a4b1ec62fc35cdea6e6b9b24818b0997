The Department of International Relations says it is investigating more diplomats in South Africa for flouting their diplomatic privileges. The Department confirmed on Friday that all diplomats from Malawi and several from Lesotho have been given 72 hours to leave South Africa after an investigation found that they were involved in the illicit trading of duty-free alcohol. They are also expected to relinquish their diplomatic status by returning all the necessary diplomatic tools to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco). On Thursday, Lesotho’s government shared their disappointment at the news their representatives from its High Commission in Pretoria were expelled from South Africa.
