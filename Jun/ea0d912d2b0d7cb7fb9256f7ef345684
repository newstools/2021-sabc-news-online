The South African Medical Association (SAMA) has warned that the coronavirus is spreading rapidly across the country by means of public transport, domestic flights and social gatherings. Gauteng is recording the most COVID-19 infections compared to other provinces. SAMA’s Chairperson Angelique Coetzee says some members of the public are failing to adhere to COVID-19 health protocols. The audio below is the full interview with Dr Coetzee:  “We still see infections coming from funerals, people flying nationally and our public transport is also going to increase the numbers of people infected. We need to look at getting people back in their houses without a lot of people around them.” “If you have your family members coming to visit you or anyone else coming to visit you at home you have to open up your windows, stay 1.5 meters away and wear a mask,” explains Coetzee. In the video below, SAMA calls for stricter lockdown measures:  Meanwhile, Gauteng Premier David Makhura has appealed for people to continue adhering to health protocols amid the province’s third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Gauteng has recorded more 471-000 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic of which 21 500 are active cases. During his media address on Friday, Makhura said, “If you look at the number of people we are losing to the pandemic it is still a matter of great concern. So we would like to say to the people of our province that we are in the middle of the third wave.” “What happens every week is of great significance about whether the pandemic is gaining more momentum or slowing down. We are not seeing evidence of better compliance. These messages are not getting out there that the pandemic is everywhere.” Gauteng Provincial Command Council media briefing:
