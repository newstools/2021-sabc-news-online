Swimming has been banned along parts of the KwaZulu-Natal coastline, from Port Edward to Isipingo, in the south of Durban. Massive sardine shoals have been spotted heading north. The KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board says there has been a spike in predator fish activity due to the annual sardine run. Acting CEO at the Sharks Board, Harry Mbambo says, “It is quite exciting this year, 2021, even though we have had some sightings coming through the other years. This year, due to very nice and cold water. It seems like it is happening quite well. It is very very important that we let our people be aware. We have had nets removed between Port Edward and Isipingo beach, meaning all swimming between those two beaches have been banned.” Harry Mbambo speaks to Lotus FM’s Newsbreak show:  In May, Shoals of sardines wete spotted making their way up the coast of the Eastern Cape towards KwaZulu-Natal. The KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board spotted the silvery fish between Mngazana Mouth and The Kraal, which is just south of Brazen Head. The sardine run is a much-anticipated phenomenon every winter.
