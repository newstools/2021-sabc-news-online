The double murder trial of a 61-year-old Mahikeng taxi owner is continuing at the North West High Court on Monday. Andrew Kube is facing two counts of murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and possession of firearms and ammunitions. Kube was arrested in 2018, after being linked to the brutal murder of the chairperson of Mahikeng/Gaborone Taxi Association Kegopotse Tawana and his daughter Kelebogile. They were gunned down at their house at Magogoe Tar village in September 2015. The suspect then fled the scene with a laptop, undisclosed amount of cash and a cellphone.
