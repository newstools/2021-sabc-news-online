The National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) says Gauteng has registered 61% of the 9 149 new coronavirus cases recorded in the latest reporting period. The NICD says South Africa is now officially in the third wave of the pandemic. It says the case positivity rate stands at 15.7% – which is more than three times what is considered acceptable. The NICD says another 100 deaths were reported – taking the overall death toll from COVID-19 to 57 410. Prof. Salim Abdool Karim reflects on increasing COVID-19 cases:  Health expert Professor Salim Abdool Karim says it is important that there is clear messaging around the pandemic at this time. “The better way to deal with this is to ensure that we take a set of generalised restrictions that people can understand, easily interpret and implement. To what extend can we really restrict interprovincial travel.” Karim adds: “Can we really protect KwaZulu-Natal by restricting travel to Gauteng? Because that’s where cases are going up in Gauteng and are low in KwaZulu-Natal. So I think, right now given where we are in the pandemic, we should get to a place where we are individually concerned and not complacent.” Latest SA stats:  SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 342 291 199 400 66 832 84 818 11 688 2 496 1 470 DEATHS 4 517 11 573 10 551 1 196 86163 489 711 80 569 53 790 298 743  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 105 932 10 JUNE ﻿2021 1 722 086 57 410 12 044 072 1 593 059 9 149 100 Total Vaccination  1 619 011 11 923 1 996 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
