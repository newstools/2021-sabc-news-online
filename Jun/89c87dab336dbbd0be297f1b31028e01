We need to ensure that everybody in this province continues to keep flattening that curve. We have already been in two waves before this, we know what to do; I don’t want to see people relaxing, people letting their guard down. We need to make sure we continue with social distance, we continue wearing our masks, hand sanitizing.” Western Cape experiences a resurgence of COVID-19 infections:  J&J vaccine The Western Cape government says it is yet to get the go-ahead to use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. This after it was suspended recently to investigate complications in the United States. Provincial Head of the Health Department, Dr Keith Cloete, says vaccine delivery is piling up and putting pressure on the system. He says about 160 000 people have been vaccinated in the province so far in line with their targets. “What we have been able to do on the daily basis as now, it put us on a store to say the available doses that we have is just enough doses to type, crate how many vaccines we can do per day for the following five or six working days; that’s where the supply is. It’s very tight now we what we have to say is we only have enough doses to do x amount of vaccinations.”
