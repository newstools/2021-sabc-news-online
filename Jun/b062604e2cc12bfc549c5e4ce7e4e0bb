The family of a 66-year-old man in Limpopo, who allegedly shot and killed his wife and their one-year-old son, say they are traumatised by the incident. The incident happened last Thursday at Folovhodwe village in Nzhelele outside Thohoyandou. Dolphin Nevhulaudzi then turned the gun on himself where his body was found lying on the street with a bullet wound. Some children witnessed the incident. A spokesperson for the Nevhulaudzi family, Fhatuwani Muzila, says they are in the process of arranging counselling for the children who witnessed the incident. “We did not think this would happen, we are traumatised. We did not think he would do such a thing, we have to accept it and live with it. We are still busy arranging for everybody who is affected to go for counselling,” says Muzila. Police Spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo says they are investigating the killings. “The police in Siloam in the Vhembe district have opened two counts of murder and one count of an inquest. This after a 66-year-old man apparently shot and killed his 43-year-old wife and their one-year-old son and thereafter his body was found laying on the street with a bullet wound in an apparent suicide. The motive of this incident could be related to domestic violence and police investigations are continuing.”
