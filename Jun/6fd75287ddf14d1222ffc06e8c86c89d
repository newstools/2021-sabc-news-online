The Modjadji Royal Council has submitted court papers to oppose a court bid to set aside its decision to appoint Prince Lekukela Modjadji as the next monarch of the Balobedu nation in Limpopo, instead of his sister, Princess Masalanabo Modjadji. Princess Masalanabo’s foster parents Dr Mathole Motshekga and his wife the Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, want the court to declare the decision null and void, arguing that it disinherits the Princess of her birthright. Dr Motshekga has also sent letters of demand against the regent of the Balobedu nation, Prince Mpapatla Modjadji and royal council spokesperson Phetole Mampeule, citing defamation of character during a press briefing held at Khithagoni royal palace in May. Mampeule says they have responded to both court challenges and are yet to hear back from the Motshekgas. “We are opposing the application by Dr Mathole Motshekga to set aside the appointment of Prince Lekukela X Modjadji as the next King of the Balobedu nation and we have instructed our legal representatives to file the necessary opposing papers and on the issue of defamation our legal representatives have responded to the allegations as brought by Dr Motshekga and we have not received any further correspondence there is no court date we are just waiting the court to make a decision.” Meanwhile, the Acting spokesperson of the Limpopo government, Willie Mosoma, has called for a speedy resolution of the impasse. “Communication has been received from the national department of COGTA. It is important to note that the appointment of traditional leadership is the sole competency of traditional leadership in consultation with royal councils whereby communication is set to the COGTA department and which is therefore referred to the office of the Premier after thorough interrogation, however, the Premier would like to make it clear that issues of traditional leadership around that area need to be solved by royal councils and royal families.”
