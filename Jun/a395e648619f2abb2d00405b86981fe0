The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has forecasted heavy rainfall over the southern part of KwaZulu-Natal. It says the downpour may cause localised flooding. The Weather Service has also warned of cold temperatures – especially in high-lying areas in the Drakensberg where it is currently snowing. Videos circulating on social media show roads and vehicles covered in snow in Nquthu in Zululand. It last snowed in Nquthu in 2004. Forecaster Julies Mahlangu says, “For today [Wednesday] we’re expecting a 80% chances of rain, mainly over the South Eastern parts of the province. We have the alert for today for heavy falls. We also have some snow falls over areas surrounding the Drakensberg that is due to the upper system which is known as the cut-off low. ” “After that cut off low we are expecting a cold front [to] move through tomorrow followed by a ridging high pressure system which is also expected to bring in more cooler conditions over the province,” adds Mahlangu.
