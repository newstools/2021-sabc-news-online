People need to commit to work with us, so recruitment of our young people (by extremist groups) stops.” No group has claimed responsibility for the raid yet. The country declared a 72-hour national mourning period in the wake of the attack. Attacks linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State have been on the rise in West Africa this year.
