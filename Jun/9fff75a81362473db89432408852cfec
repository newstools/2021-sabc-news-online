The Restaurant Association of South Africa (RASA) says its sector will be the hardest hit after the country moved to level 4 lockdown. The association says while it appreciates there are difficult choices to be made due to COVID-19, there has been no consultation, financial support nor remedy for the sector. RASA warns there will be thousands of jobs lost due to the newly announced restrictions. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the sector could no longer have sit-ins at Level 4 and can only serve takeaways. The restaurant industry says government has no plan nor financial support for the sector which has been bleeding jobs and closing businesses since last year. RASA spokesperson Wendy Alberts says they also don’t have any tax deferment or halting of leases or rent in places where they operate, and this will pose a huge challenge for the sector. Alberts adds that the sector is calling on government to support the industry. “We have been called to close our businesses and we’re not in a position to trade and yet we are still expected to pay 100 percent of our debt. This is absolutely unconstitutional there is no mention of the Temporary Employment Relief Scheme [Ters]. And there is still no extraditing of vaccines.” “If we are at the forefront and we have been targeted yet again as an industry where we are labelled responsible for the spread of COVID-19, why are [we] not getting the vaccines. We have to remodel our businesses again and the insurances have become very tricky, rewritten our policies with us. The banks are still demanding our payments,” says Alberts.
