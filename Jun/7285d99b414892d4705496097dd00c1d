As the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to put Health Minister Zweli Mkhize on special leave was announced, the African National Congress (ANC) National Working Committee (NWC) slammed insinuations that Mkhize’s woes may be politically motivated. Mkhize on Tuesday apologised for the dark cloud the allegations around Communications Company Digital Vibes have caused. Mkhize is implicated in the issuing of a contract to Digital Vibes worth R150-million. The insinuations relate to the fact that Mkhize is being smeared to avoid him threatening President Ramaphosa’s bid for a second term. ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte has welcomed Mkhize’s apology.   “We welcome the decision by Comrade Zweli Mkhize to present himself to the Integrity Commission, in line with the resolution of the 54th National Conference. The NWC rejected any insinuation that investigations by law enforcement agencies in general and the SIU (Special Investigating Unit) , in particular, have been influenced by factors other than those provided for in the law. Investigations by the SIU are initiated at the request of government departments or other state institutions. They are formally proclaimed by the President once due legal processes have been followed.” In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, the Presidency said the special leave period “will enable the Minister to attend to allegations and investigations concerning contracts between the Department of Health and a service provider, Digital Vibes”. Minister of Tourism, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, will serve as the  Acting Minister of Health. President Ramaphosa places Minister Mkhize on special leave:
