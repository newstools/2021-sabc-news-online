Eskom has announced that Stage 1 load shedding will start at 5pm on Monday until 10pm. The power utility says this is because of “further breakdowns and delays in returning generating units”. Eskom says the implementation of load shedding is due to the loss of generation units at Kusile, Kendal and Tutuka Power Stations. “These constraints have been exacerbated by delays in returning a unit each at Kusile, Duvha and Matla Power Stations,” notes Eskom in a statement. Eskom says the likelihood of load shedding is high for the rest of the week as the power system remains constrained and vulnerable.
