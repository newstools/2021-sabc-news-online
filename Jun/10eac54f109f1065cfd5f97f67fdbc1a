Free Movement of Basotho, a social movement of Basotho based in South Africa and the Kingdom of Lesotho, wants Lesotho to be incorporated into South Africa. The Movement has called for a referendum in Lesotho to allow Basotho to vote if they want Lesotho to remain a sovereign state, or be incorporated as the 10th province into South Africa. It was formed in 2009 with the aim to try and advocate for the rights of Basotho people in South Africa. Some of the reasons cited are political instability and the fact that Lesotho is heavily reliant on South Africa in terms of economic growth. It is now advocating for the postponement of the general elections set to take place in 2022, in Lesotho. The Lesotho High Commission in Pretoria is yet to comment. Free Movement of Basotho is calling on the new government of Lesotho to advance their demands that borders with South Africa be abolished. â€” SAfm news (@SAfmnews) July 2, 2017  Video: Calls for a referendum in Lesotho
