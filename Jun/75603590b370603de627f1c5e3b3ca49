Deputy President David Mabuza in his capacity as the chairperson of the Presidential Task Team on Military Veterans is expected to interact with military veterans at Polokwane in Limpopo. He is to assess progress achieved by the provincial government in addressing challenges faced by military veterans. For years, military veterans from both former liberation political parties and the then Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda and Ciskei (TBVC states), have been complaining that government is not doing enough to take care of their livelihood. Amongst other things the task team led by Deputy President Mabuza identified, is the need for social distress relief, providing educational assistance, decent housing and land for military veterans. In a statement from the Presidency, the Task Team continues to receive reports on progress achieved by different departments, to come up with a legislative framework to help military veterans.
