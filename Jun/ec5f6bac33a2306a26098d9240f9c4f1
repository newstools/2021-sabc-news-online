The Special Investigating Unit’s (SIU) report on its probe into communications company, Digital Vibes, is expected to be ready on Wednesday after which it will be handed over to President Cyril Ramaphosa. The SIU was granted the preservation order last week to freeze about R22 million held in bank and investment accounts linked to entities or individuals that received payments from Digital Vibes. The firm is at the centre of a R150 million COVID-19 media campaign contract that the Department of Health had awarded it. The SIU’s freezing order comes about two weeks after Ramaphosa placed Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize on special leave while the investigation into the Digital Vibes contract was being concluded. Mkhize has been linked to certain people in the company who had previously worked closely with him.
