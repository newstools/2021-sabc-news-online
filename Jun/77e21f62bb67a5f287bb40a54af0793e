South African National Parks (SAN-Parks) says it’s in shock following the killing of suspected rhino poaching kingpin, Sydney Mabuza. He was gunned down execution-style in Hazyview, Mpumalanga, on Thursday. Mabuza was due to stand trial soon on his alleged involvement in rhino poaching. He was out on R200 000 bail.
