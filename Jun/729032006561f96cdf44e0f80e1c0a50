The Hawks says they will not comment on speculation that Malawian self-proclaimed prophet, Chipiloro Gama, commonly known as Shepherd Bushiri; was in the country and has once again evaded arrest. The City Press reported that security agencies are investigating credible claims that the wanted fugitive and his wife Mary, have been in the country several times since his dramatic escape in 2020. The paper reports that the Bushiris most recent visit was two months ago. The Hawks’ Philane Nkwalase has called on anyone with information to come forward. “We will, therefore, not be drawn to comment on speculation on this matter. We, therefore, appeal to anyone with credible evidence that supports these speculations that are doing rounds, to come forward with that information to the police. At the right time, we will bring the country into confidence once there are notable developments on that process.” The Directorate says the process of bringing Bushiri back to South Africa is being handled by competent authorities in line with extradition arrangements, therefore, at the right time, it will inform the country of any developments regarding the extradition process.
