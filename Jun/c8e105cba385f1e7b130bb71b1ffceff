A new employment centre has been opened in Newcastle in northern KwaZulu-Natal to assist youth to enter the job market, as South Africa battles rising unemployment rates. The centre has been launched by Minister of Employment and Labour Thulas Nxesi and is set to provide services such as career counselling, CV generation and working with job databases. Acting Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) Commissioner Teboho Thejane says, “Through the Minister, we are opening an employment youth centre. The youth centre has got a number of facilities. One is computers, where any member of the society who needs to register themselves as a job seeker will just enter the youth centre, get into the kiosk, put their information into the kiosk and it will assist them to create a CV, and based on that CV. The system will then match them to job opportunities out there and then there would be a referral.” PICS: Part of the 8 mobile buses fleet launched today, delivering UIF Services to the people of Amajuba District Municipality in Newcastle.
