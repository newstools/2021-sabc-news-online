Eskom has announced that Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 10am on Wednesday until 10pm on Friday. The power utility says this is due to the breakdown of generating units at the Majuba and Arnot Power stations. Eskom also says there were delays in returning generating units. The extensive use of emergency generation reserves – like diesel turbines – over the last few days has also resulted in these being depleted. #POWERALERT2 Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 10:00 on Wednesday morning until 22:00 on
