As COVID-19 infections continue to rapidly increase and with fears that the country is officially on a third wave, President Cyril Ramaphosa will be locked in several meetings on Tuesday in a bid to find a better response to the pandemic. South Africa is on Alert Level two of the national lockdown. But it seems regulations under this level are failing to curb the fast-increasing number of infections. For the past seven days, the country recorded COVID-19 infections well over 20 000 prompting government to take action.
