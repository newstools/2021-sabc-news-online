The Democratic Alliance (DA) says it is finalising a Private Members Bill to amend the Referendums Act to enable Premiers to call a provincial referendum on crucial service delivery issues. The DA is finalising a Bill to amend the Referendums Act to give effect to the Constitutional powers of Premiers to call a provincial referendum. Greater devolution of powers to Provinces is necessary for better policing, rails and electricity generation.https://t.co/4XCFWK2ikw â€” Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) June 11, 2021  Party Chief Whip Natasha Mazzone says in its current form, the Referendums Act only allows for the President to call a referendum. She says the draft Bill seeks to address this omission. Mazzone says an amendment will enable Premiers to ensure that their residents can make their voices heard on important issues. The DA says the government has failed in addressing issues such as rail transport, police deployment and electricity generation.
