The African National Congress’ Mopani district elective conference is expected to resume on Sunday at Tzaneen in Limpopo. The conference was delayed on Saturday due to issues around COVID-19 regulations, including the curfew. Provincial ANC spokesperson Donald Selamolela says delegates will vote for the new regional executive leadership on Sunday. It is being hosted at four venues to comply with COVID-19 regulations. Selamolela says the conference will end on Monday. “The Mopani conference will resume this morning, after the failed ability to start last night. We spent the better part of yesterday dealing with registration under the circumstances of covid-19 things are not easy especially around ensuring that we register observing social distance and so forth so that warranted a particular delay for all of us. The conference will open this morning and it will proceed until tomorrow whereby this afternoon, today, the leadership will be elected.” Scores of delegates have gathered at the different venues that will be linked virtually to comply with COVID-19 regulations.
