Mopping up operations have started in the Coldstream and Koopmansbos areas of Tsitsikamma in the Eastern Cape, following veld fires that started on Monday. Over 2 400 hectares of commercial plantations and natural veld have been destroyed. The Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment worked with non-governmental organisations to put out the fire. Department spokesperson Nthabiseng Mokone says the fire is under control. “Five Working on Fire teams, SanParks and MOT firefighters together with seven tankers are working at Coldstream area this morning to do mopping up and patrolling while two WOF teams are based in Koopmansbos area also doing mop up and monitoring. The fire is under control and all Southern Cape teams, Aeriel resources and Sarah Baartman Fire Services were released this morning from this fire.” Mokone adds: “The weather condition has improved and light drizzling rain assisted a lot in the fire suppression operations. All efforts will focus to get the fire contained completely.”
