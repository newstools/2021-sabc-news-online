Morocco will reopen its airports and ports to international passenger traffic from June 15, both for its citizens and foreign nationals. The country has so far reported 521 426  COVID-19 infections and 9 178 since the pandemic began. Morocco has administered over 15 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that’s enough to have vaccinated about 20.6% of the country’s population. Morocco started a national coronavirus vaccination campaign in January after receiving vaccine shipments from AstraZeneca and Sinopharm, state media said at the time.
