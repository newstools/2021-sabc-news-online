Two men accused of the murder of a 21-year-old Paul Roux farm manager, Brandin Horner, are expected to apply for bail in the Senekal Magistrate’s Court in the Free State on Tuesday. Last week, the court heard that DNA results of blood stains found on the clothes of Sekwetje Mahlamba and Sekola Matlaletsa did not match those of the deceased. Horner’s murder fueled racial tensions in the eastern Free State town. Members of the farming community from all over the country descended upon Senekal on the first day of Mahlamba and Matlaletsa’s court appearance. They stormed the court building demanding that the accused be handed over to them. A police vehicle was also burned in the rampage. Free State National Prosecuting Authority Spokesperson, Phaladi Shuping, says: “This is after they were denied bail by the same court in October last year. The NPA intends to oppose their release on bail because we are still maintaining that it is not in the interest of justice for the accused to be released on bail.” Mahlamba, 32, and 44-year-old Matlaletsa allegedly strangled and stabbed Horner and left his body tied to the bottom of a pole in October 2020.
