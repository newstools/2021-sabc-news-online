Taiwan calls on China to return power to the people and embark upon real political reform rather than avoiding facing up to the bloody 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing. Friday will mark 32 years since Chinese troops opened fire to end the student-led unrest in and around the square. The government has never released a full death toll, but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from 700 to 7000. In a statement, the government of democratically-ruled and Chinese-claimed Taiwan, on the anniversaryâ€™s eve, says Beijing was avoiding saying sorry for what had happened or reflecting on its mistakes.
