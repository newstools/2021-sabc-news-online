Former Transnet CFO, Anoj Singh, says he doesn’t know why a Gupta-linked shelf company, Homix, was paid over R40 million in a success fee, by Transnet, for its role in facilitating a deal between the State-Owned Entity and telecoms firm Neotel. Singh says Neotel had a gun on their head because they owned the telecoms infrastructure at Transnet and were forced to renew their contract. Singh was giving evidence at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg. In 2014, Transnet concluded a R1.8 billion deal with Neotel, but Homix was awarded money to oversee negotiations despite it not offering any service. “The consultant agrees to undertake and analyse the requirements for both Neotel and Transnet to find a workable solution to the impasse of negotiations. (Anoj) Again Mr chair I cannot comment on that. But then why if Homix wasn’t involved why was Neotel paying then this money have you got any idea (Anoj) No sir…” For Anoj Singh’s testimony, see video link below:
