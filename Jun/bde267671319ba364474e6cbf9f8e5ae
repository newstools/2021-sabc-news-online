Former Democratic Alliance (DA) MP Phumzile Van Damme has resigned from the party. Van Damme took to Twitter to announce her decision. I have decided to terminate my DA membership. The misinformation monitoring and combatting project we will be rolling out during election season requires that I be non-partisan. Our plans are at an advanced stage. South Africa, first. Always has been. — Phumzile Van Damme (@zilevandamme) June 26, 2021  She is the latest prominent member to leave the DA. Last month, Van Damme tendered her resignation to the Speaker of the National Assembly Thandi Modise as a Member of Parliament but stayed on as a party member of the DA. “I have had a full and life-shaping journey as a Democratic Alliance (DA) activist, staff member, the longest-serving National Spokesperson from 2014 to 2018, and a Shadow Minister, which I put my all into,” said Van Damme in a statement at the time. She said then she would not be joining another party. She served the DA in various capacities including party national spokesperson from 2014 to 2018 and a Shadow Minister. Van Damme was placed on special leave by the party in November 2020 without consultation. To all the people in my mentions, let me make on thing very clear. I wasn’t in the DA because I had no other options in life, ngafunda. No gave me anything, I am where I am because of MY hard work. I didn’t need the DA to survive, I chose it. And now, I’m choosing a new path. — Phumzile Van Damme (@zilevandamme) June 26, 2021  The Democratic Alliance says it has noted the decision by its former MP to terminate her membership of the party. DA spokesperson Siviwe Gwarube says, “The Democratic Alliance has noted Van Damme’s decision to terminate her membership. The party understands her need for complete neutrality in her new endeavours. We wish her well for this important work.”
