Chairperson of the Western Cape Standing Committee on Human Settlements, Matlhodi Maseko, says it is unfortunate that the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development did not participate in a webinar today to update them on matters pertaining to the District Six Restitution Projects. On Thursday, Minister Thoko Didiza announced that they will today begin the administrative process of allocating 108 claimants their housing units. She said the process of the claimants returning to the area will take place between 24 June and 16 July. Maseko says, however, the problem is that illegal occupiers have moved onto land in the area. “There is a land invasion that is happening in the land parcel of the District Six land restitution site. The responsibility now is with the city, the cost is with the city. I don’t know if the department will eventually take responsibility for that or not. But that’s what is happening now and we have to see how we are going to move forward in this issue.”
