Co-convenor of Progressive Health Forum, Dr Aslam Dasoo has urged government to look out for other vaccines that are available in the market to speed up the vaccination programme. His comments come as the Basic Education Department kick-starts a vaccination programme on Wednesday in the sector. Dasoo says currently it is at snail’s pace with the peak of the coronavirus third wave looming. He says the move by government to vaccinate workers at the education sector is an important decision if learning is to continue. Dasoo says the country also has to widen the pipeline of acquisition and the moment, the government is the only agency that can acquire vaccines. He says, “We started very late acquiring the vaccine and have been at the back of the queue ever since and it doesn’t help these events that happened at the Johnson and Johnson plan in the United States. That highlights the danger of keeping all our eggs in one or two baskets only. Offcourse, we have to widen range of vaccines that are available to us.” Below is the full interview with by Dr. Dasoo: SABC News Reporter Simphiwe Makhanya interviews KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Education, Kwazi Mshengu about the vaccine rollout.
