The Democratic Alliance (DA) has objected to the adoption of the Employment Amendment Equity Bill by Parliamentâ€™s Portfolio Committee on Employment and Labour. The official opposition has labelled the amendments as fruit from a poisoned tree. The Bill proposes a number of changes to the Employment Equity Act and allows the Minister of Labour to determine numerical targets to ensure equitable representation at all occupational levels of the workforce. It will now be sent to the National Assembly for possible approval. The Freedom Front Plus has also objected to the bill.
