The National Council of Provinces will on Wednesday morning consider the follow-up report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Section 100 intervention of the Constitution in the North West Province. The committee adopted the report on Monday with the Democratic Alliance (DA) abstaining and Freedom Front Plus (FF-Plus) opposing it. The DA and FF-Plus did not agree with all the recommendations during the deliberations of the report. The report will be brought before the House for final approval on Wednesday morning. The interventions into the North West dates back to 2018 when government invoked Section 100 of the Constitution to place certain provincial departments under administration. The decision to intervene was sparked by a lack of service delivery which saw violence during protest action.
