Advocate Wim Trengove, representing African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa in the Ace Magashule case, has refuted as false claims by Magashule that he is being targeted by the ANC’s step-aside resolution. The case is being heard in the High Court in Johannesburg. During arguments by advocate Mahlape Sello, on behalf of the suspended ANC Secretary-General,  highlighted that the step-aside rule seeks to target certain individuals in the party and that it is unconstitutional. However, advocate Trengove says the resolution is being implemented for all members facing corruption allegations. “The party did an audit of everybody in the provinces who are liable to step-aside and failed to do so and then invoke the step aside rule against those very many prominent people. In the report you will see the in protecting them, their names have been reduced, but there are very many names referred to. Mr. Magashule complains about the fact that the president of the ANC is annexed his indictment,” says Ramaphosa’s legal representative. Part 1 of live stream below: Part 2 of live stream below:  Yesterday, the court heard how Magashule’s rights were infringed by the terms of his suspension. These included not performing his duties, speaking on or behalf of the organisation, and mobilising across ANC structures. Advocate Dali Mpofu who is representing Magashule, told Judge Jody Kollapen that Magashule’s ban from participating in any party activities was unconstitutional. The court also dismissed, with costs, the application of Magashule’s backers who wanted to accepted as intervening parties.
