Sharma appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court for alleged fraud, corruption and money laundering relating to the R24.9 million which was paid by the Agriculture Department to conduct a feasibility study into farming projects in the Free State. Sharma and former Free State Agriculture Department head Peter Thabethe will spend the weekend in custody, following their first appearance in the court. The other accused, Limakatso Moorosi and Seipati Dlamini, were released on bail of R10 000. The freeze order will be served on Sharma at the Bloemfontein Bainslvlei Police holding cells, while Islandsite will be served at its local business address.
