Gauteng law enforcement agencies have arrested a suspect linked to a series of killings in the taxi industry in Katlehong in Ekurhuleni. Incidents of violent killings of taxi owners and operators have marred the industry in the province in recent months leaving scores dead. Gauteng Traffic Police spokesperson Sello Maremane says the suspect was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm and live ammunition. Maremane says, “The suspect is allegedly linked to an incident which happened last in the Tshwane district outside the Pretoria pathologist services where a traffic officer and a member of South African Police Service were injured, one person also lost his life during the incident.” An investigation into a suspected serial killer continues at this stage. At the beginning of June, nine suspects were arrested and three firearms recovered following a shooting at Fordsburg in Johannesburg. When police responded to the scene, they found one person dead and five patrol cars from a taxi association damaged. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela says the nine suspects have been taken into custody. Makhubela says, “Upon searching the suspects’ car, police recovered three firearms which will be taken for ballistic testing to establish whether or not they may have been used in the commission of other crimes.” “The suspects will be charged with murder and possession of unlicensed firearms. They will further be profiled to determine if they are not linked to other crimes, especially the taxi violence-related crimes,” added Makhubela.
