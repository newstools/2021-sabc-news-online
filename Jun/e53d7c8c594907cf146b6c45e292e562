State veterinarian for the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr Themba Sikhakhane is appealing to livestock farmers in northern KwaZulu-Natal to remain vigilant to prevent the spread of the current foot and mouth outbreak in the area. The department is currently visiting dipping tanks in northern KwaZulu-Natal to conduct an assessment on cattle. A temporary ban is also in place on the movement of livestock to prevent the spread of the disease. The affected areas include King Cetshwayo and Zululand. Sikhakhane is appealing to farmers to wait for the results of the assessment to establish a way forward. “The national minister has declared a standstill that said the animals within uMkhanyakude, King Cetshwayo, Ulundi,  Nongoma and Pongola, people should desist from moving animals while we are assessing the extent of the spread of the disease.” “We plead with our people to comply with that standstill until we finish doing our assessment. We will then inform the public as to which is the control area and what strategy we will employ going forward in trying to eliminate this problem,” explains Sikhakhane.
