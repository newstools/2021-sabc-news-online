African National Congress (ANC) staff members will embark on a nationwide picket at lunch-time on Tuesday, over the governing party’s failure to pay their salaries on time. The ANC has been experiencing financial problems with reports that it owed the South African Revenue Service (SARS) R80 million in Pay As You Earn deductions. In the video below ANC Treasurer-General Paul Mashatile explained how the party was planning to raise some funds:  The party was also in arrears by at least 28 months or around R140 million on its provident fund which was deducted from workers’ salaries. Dozens of protesting workers are expected to hand over their memorandum of demands at the party’s headquarters, Luthuli House in Johannesburg. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says they have encouraged all their provincial leaders to receive memoranda from workers.  @MYANC statement on staff salary payments. pic.twitter.com/YsJ6BxZMzP — African National Congress (@MYANC) June 9, 2021   In 2020, the ANC blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for its failure to pay staff salaries.
