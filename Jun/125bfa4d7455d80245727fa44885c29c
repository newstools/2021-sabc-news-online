The Kingdom of Lesotho has expressed shock and disappointment over the expulsion of some of its diplomats from South Africa. Several foreign government officials from Lesotho and all Malawi’s diplomats were declared persona non grata by South Africa’s Department of International Relations. They were given 72 hours to leave after an investigation found that they abused their diplomatic privileges through their involvement in the illicit trade of duty-free alcohol. They apparently bought alcohol in bulk from duty-free shops and sold it to shebeens in South Africa for personal gain. Dirco has confirmed that more officials are being investigated.

That was due to misuse of money by countries that were mentioned. And we were mentioned amongst those countries. When a person is now declared person non-grata it is for the country to make sure they declare that person outside that country within the stipulated time, because if they stay they will be arrested,” says Ramakoae.  Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) has confirmed that more officials are being investigated.
