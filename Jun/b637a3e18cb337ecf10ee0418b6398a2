Former Public Enterprises minister, Malusi Gigaba says he believes his now estranged wife, Noma had testified against him at the State Capture Commission out of bitterness and malice. Noma Mngoma, in her recent testimony, said that the Gupta family had gifted Gigaba with jewellery, a vehicle and bags of cash, among others. The former minister was testifying at the Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg, on Friday. “That anger and bitterness about not being able to extract more settlement prove that this is the person who came here to say when he was the minister he used to give me money. Now that he is no longer a minister and probably no longer has the ability to help me afford that type of lifestyle, I should therefore demand this lifestyle or a payment.” “She does have money, lots of it. But this is a person who loves money and wants more of it and is angry that I cannot afford to spend all my future savings today [at the present moment] ,” adds Gigaba. Live proceedings below:  She testified against me because divorce settlement did not go her way Gigaba told the commission that Mngoma testified against him because their divorce settlement did not go her way. On Thursday night, Gigaba was cross-examined on his estranged wife’s earlier evidence. In her testimony,  Mngoma said Gigaba had asked police to confiscate her gadgets and destroy all pictures of their trips to Mauritius and Dubai. This was allegedly to conceal evidence from the commission on the trips allegedly paid for by Ajay Gupta and former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni. But in his rebuttal, Gigaba said Mngoma mentioned all this because she is bitter. Mngoma testified that Gigaba agreed on a divorce settlement expecting her not to testify against him at the commission. Thursday’s proceedings:
