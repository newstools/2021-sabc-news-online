The Salvation Army is deeply concerned about a spike in instances of human trafficking in the country. The NGO says it receives up to a dozen calls every week and 8% of which are related to human trafficking. This week, the Hawks in Gauteng rescued a thirteen-year-old girl from her stepmother and step-grandmother who allegedly tried to sell her to human traffickers. The Salvation Army anti-trafficking coordinator, Juanita Wright, has this advice for parents: “How much online time the child is spending? Who the child is talking to? Who they’re friends with? What they are associated with? And also just teaching our kids to be observant of the environment they around. If they suspect anything, obviously they draw attention to themselves in that they are in the shopping mall than the nearest security guard and an adult but always they must be observant of the environment.” Human trafficking on the rise:  Last month, the Hawks arrested two high-ranking police officers for alleged human trafficking and defeating the ends of justice. A Brigadier and a Captain based in Vereeniging in the Vaal, are accused of raping a woman who had been kidnapped and taken to a brothel. The officers’ identity has been concealed until they appear in court. Hawks arrest two high-ranking police officers for alleged human trafficking:
