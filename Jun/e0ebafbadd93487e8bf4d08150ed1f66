Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize says he has discussed taking special leave with President Cyril Ramaphosa pending an investigation against him. Mkhize is implicated in the issuing of a contract to communications company Digital Vibes worth R150-million. The Minister is also preparing himself to appear before the African National Congress’ (ANC) intergrity committee. Mkhize was speaking in Kimberley in the Northerbn Cape, where was inspecting COVID-19 vaccination sites. “We have discussed the issue of the special leave. I’ve actually raised that with the President and so we will wait for those processes. In due course, the President will give us the guidance. I have spoken to the Chairperson of the Intergrity Committee Commission. I have written them a later to say there were information we needed to collate and therefore once that is ready we will be going to present ourselves to the Integrity Committee. As things stand, now they actually confirmed that they have received communication,” says Mkhize. Video: Digital vibes | For all of this I want to apologise: Mkhize
