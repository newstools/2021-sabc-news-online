A member of the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in KwaZulu-Natal has taken legal action against ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte and the National Youth Task Team(NYTT). 32-year-old Qiniso Matinisa from oThongathi, north of Durban, says Duarte and the NYTT have allowed people over the age of 35 to remain in the youth league’s provincial structures. In court papers, Matinisa says all youth league structures, including those in provinces,  lapsed some years ago and that there are some members of the structures who are now older than 35. “Provinces have a leadership whose term of office lapsed. Secondly, they have members older than 35 years, but they’re presiding over the youth league. That’s where I’m asking ANC clarity of how can you say people over 35 must excuse themselves in NYTT, but when it comes to provinces you don’t do the same.” Efforts to get a comment from the ANC were unsuccessful. The matter is expected to be heard in the South Gauteng High Court on 18 August 2021.
