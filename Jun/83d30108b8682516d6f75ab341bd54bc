The suspects will be appearing alongside a fourth suspect who was arrested when the police pulled over a bakkie towing a 12-foot ski boat on the highway with 800 kilograms of cocaine hidden. Rafiek Baderoen, Rashied Baderoen and Michael Norman were arrested in Cape Town for their alleged involvement and appeared in the Strand Magistrate’s Court last Monday. The three were escorted to Pretoria from Cape Town under heavy police guard. The bust involved various law enforcement agencies including, the Hawks, the FBI, and the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The cocaine is believed to have been destined for both local and international markets. Another suspect Ahmad Isa (41) is sought by the South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB) for his alleged involvement in the drugs haul.
