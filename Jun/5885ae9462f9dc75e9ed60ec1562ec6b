Delays in the completion of two mega projects at Medupi and Kusile Power Stations have contributed to the problem of load shedding in the country. This was revealed during an oversight visit to Medupi Power station in Limpopo by Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises. The Committee says management also expressed concern about aging power stations and inadequate maintenance. Committee chairperson Khaya Magaxa says growing the economy will be difficult without an efficient energy supply. He says construction of Medupi began in 2007 and to date over R120-billion has been spent on the coal-powered electricity plant. Yesterday, Eskom assured members of Parliament that all six units at Medupi Power Station are working and contributing to the national grid. The country experienced load shedding at the beginning of the month due to problems at power stations. Technical issues and design defects are often cited as some of the problems leading to power stations underperforming. The Committee is today visiting Kusile Power Station in Emalahleni in Mpumalanga.
