Free State Police have arrested three suspects in connection with the murder of an eight-year-old girl. Bokamoso Shabe’s body was found in an open field in Riebeckstad in Welkom on Thursday. She was reportedly kidnapped just outside her school on Monday. Her gruesome murder has shattered the family. Mapaseka Shabe says she had high hopes for her daughter. The devastated mother could not hold back her tears. She says she last spoke to Bokamoso on Wednesday, when the kidnappers allowed her to talk to her over the phone. “I never thought I will be where I am now. I have not accepted what happened. I was expecting to see my daughter grow up, working and reaching her dreams. I did not expect that at the age of 8 I will lose her.” Her grandmother, Nyalleng Shabe, says she received a series of calls from unknown people, claiming to have Bokamoso. They demanded R50 000 in ransom. “We received a call on Monday from someone saying they have Bokamoso and they are in town. He called again when we were at the police station saying we should pay him R50 000 to get her and that’s when police took the phone and he dropped it.” Two women and a man are expected to appear before the Welkom Magistrate’s Court on Monday in connection with the murder. “Our team came across a gruesome scene where her body was found. This after a visit to a suspected male’s house, who after being questioned led the team to the scene in Riebeeckstad, Welkom, where the body was found wrapped up with duvet cover in an open field. She was still wearing her school uniform. A case of murder has been opened for further investigation,” says Free State Police Spokesperson, Motantsi Makhele. The family says they were horrified when they realised the suspects were people they had hired to do repairs on their house.
