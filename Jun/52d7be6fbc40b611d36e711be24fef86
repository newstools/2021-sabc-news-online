President Cyril Ramaphosa has rallied South Africans to be persistent and practice discipline to win the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. In his weekly message to the nation, Ramaphosa has highlighted the seriousness of the third wave which is sweeping the country, hitting Gauteng particularly hard. He says the task of controlling the virus is not just one for the vulnerable or healthcare workers but requires every South African to do their part. President Ramaphosa says with the steep and rapid climb in new cases, a 15 fold increase from early April, citizens need to invest time and effort to control the pandemic and see a payoff, in terms of falling cases, reduced deaths and economic recovery. South Africa has reported 13 155 new COVID-19 cases, taking the total number of infections to 1 823 319. There have been 112 new COVID-19-related deaths, pushing the national death toll to 58 702.
