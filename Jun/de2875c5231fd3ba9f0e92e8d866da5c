The Mayor of the Greater Taung Local Municipality in the North West, Oageng Seleka, has resigned. Seleka was appointed as the Mayor of the municipality two months ago after the previous Mayor, Kgosi Motlhabane, was removed through a motion of no confidence. The North West African National Congress (ANC) Interim Provincial Committee has criticised municipalities for removing mayors through motions of no confidence. Seleka says he was not forced to resign. Seleka says, “I decided to listen to the ANC to say irrespective of the circumstances that are invading, let me listen to the ANC and hand over my resignation. I am doing this after engaging with the leadership of the ANC because they consider that the proof of the ANC is not allowing us to carry on with the decision that was taken by the council. However, I am not saying the council took the wrong decision, I still believe that the council took the right decision.” In April the Taung Mayor was removed from office:  The trend of removing ANC mayors in the North West through motions of no confidence seemed to continue with the removal of Mayor Nyoko Motlhabane two months ago during a special council meeting, through a motion tabled by the Economic Freedom Fighters. Motlhabane was the second mayor to be removed in this manner in less than a week, following the removal of Madibeng Mayor, Jostina Mothibi.
