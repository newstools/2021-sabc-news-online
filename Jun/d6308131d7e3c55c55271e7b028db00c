Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, has highlighted the significance of the Constitutional Court’s judgment against former President Jacob Zuma. He told the media that the judgment underlined the importance of accountability in a constitutional democracy. On Tuesday, the Constitutional Court sentenced Zuma to 15 months in jail for contempt of court, violating the authority of the court and repeatedly attacking the dignity of the judiciary. Former President Jacob Zuma’s contempt case judgment:  Zuma has until Sunday to present himself to a police station either in Nkandla in Northern KwaZulu-Natal or in Johannesburg. If Zuma fails to do so, Police Minister Bheki Cele and the National Commissioner General Khehla Sitole must ensure that he is delivered to prison authorities. Zondo said: “We welcome the judgment. We think the judgment is of great importance in our constitutional democracy. It vindicates the rule of law in our country. It vindicates the supremacy of our constitution. It reaffirms the principle that we are all equal before the law. It underlies the importance of accountability in our constitutional democracy.” Below is the media briefing by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo:
