The Black Business Council has described as ‘regrettable’ the negative financial impact COVID-19 restrictions could have on some businesses. This after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the new adjusted Alert Level 4 restrictions on Sunday night among them a ban on the sale of liquor. The restrictions are due to last for 14 days. President of the Black Business Council, Sandile Zungu says, “Let’s concede that the task that they have is a very difficult task. There is no question about it – the hospitality industry suffers a great deal. Alcohol sales, which are a legitimate form of commerce in SA, have a right to thrive but they suffer.” “When South Africans have alcohol in their hands they seem to make us go wild and hence there is pressure on the nation’s wards in hospitals. In the face of COVID, we know what the priorities should be. It is regrettable, but we have empathy for the situation in which government finds itself in.” South Africa has moved to an adjusted lockdown Level 4 this week, with all social gatherings prohibited. Funerals are restricted to a maximum of 50 people. No night vigils or post-funeral gatherings are permitted. In his address to the nation, Ramaphosa said government’s focus is on limiting social contact to flatten the curve and contain the further spread of the COVID-19 virus. South Africa has reported 15 036 new cases in the past 24-hour reporting period, taking the total number of infections to 1 928 897. There are 158 998 active cases in the country. There were 122 reported deaths overnight, pushing the death toll to 59 900. The recovery rate is 88.7%. Under adjusted lockdown Alert Level 4, restaurants and other eateries may only serve food for takeaway or delivery. Outside of work, South Africans are urged to only meet with members of their households. The President says the closure of schools for the winter holidays will be brought forward to this Friday – 2 July 2021.
