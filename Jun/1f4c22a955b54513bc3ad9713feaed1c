Former Public Protector, Professor Thuli Madonsela, says former President, Jacob Zuma has nobody but himself to blame after he was sentenced to 15 months in jail by the Constitutional Court for contempt of court. Thank you Vuyo Mvoko, #TheWatchdog and ⁦@SABCNews⁩ for the privilege to discuss the #ZumaJudgement on contempt of court #Grateful pic.twitter.com/dC3BtNpqny — Prof Thuli Madonsela #MelosKingdom (@ThuliMadonsela3) June 29, 2021  The country’s apex court had directed Zuma to appear before the State Capture Commission. However, the former President ignored the directive. Madonsela says Zuma was given many chances to engage the relevant stakeholders regarding his pending cases: “We have to have a heart of stone not to feel sorry for the former President given the fact that he has to go to jail at his age. That he has been singled out no. I think the courts have been bending a little bit backwards to meet him were he his. He had chosen not to engage with it in this particular matter.”
