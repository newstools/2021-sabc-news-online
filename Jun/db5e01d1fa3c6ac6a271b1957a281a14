The National Prosecuting Authority’s Investigating Directorate says it’s making progress in prosecuting people allegedly responsible for the plundering of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and rampant corruption. It currently has 16 cases involving billions of rand lost due to corruption in several courts across the country. Restraint orders on assets belonging to some of the accused are at over R2 billion. In the case against former Transnet Board member and Gupta family associate, Iqbal Sharma, the restraint order for assets is unlimited. Investigating Directorate Spokesperson, Sindisiwe Seboka, says although it has limited capacity, recent progress with the extradition of the Gupta family shows they do not give up even when suspects flee the country. Seboka says the extradition hearing for former Eskom contractor Michael Lomas, who has been implicated in a R745 million corruption scandal involving the construction of Kusile power station, has been set for the end of this year. “With the Michael Lomas-matter, the Eskom R750 million Kusile, Mpumalanga-matter we have been able to set that matter down for trial in the London Westminster’s Court within a period of a year. We are coming for each and every person who defrauded the state in any shape or form that falls in our mandate that we were created for. What we are going to do relentlessly is to pursue as many people as we possibly can,” she adds. The NPA is also trying to bring the Gupta family back in South Africa to answer to corruption, fraud and money laundering allegations. Talks with the United Arab Emirates in a bid to have them extradited are under way. The NPA has also issued warrants of arrest for some members of the family. Interpol arrest warrant for Guptas:
