Another five Northern Cape schools have temporarily closed due to COVID-19 infections. The provincial department of education says 29 schools had to close for disinfection and to allow for isolation of those who tested positive since the beginning of June. “We recorded 103 new positive cases for the past week, which includes 69 learners, 25 educators and 9 support staff at schools,” says provincial education department Spokesperson, Geoffrey Van Der Merwe. Van Der Merwe is pleading with parents to cooperate with schools as they implement recovery plans. “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact enormously on valuable learning and teaching time in terms of curriculum coverage across all grades. We plead with parents to provide schools with the necessary cooperation as they implement their curriculum recovery plans. It is very important that all learners remain on par with their schoolwork, whilst parents provide them with the necessary support at home,” adds Van Der Merwe.
