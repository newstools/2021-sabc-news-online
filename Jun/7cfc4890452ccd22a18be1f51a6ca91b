The Hawks’ South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB) is on the hunt for Ahmed Isa, 41, for alleged involvement in a drug syndicate after cocaine worth R400 million was confiscated on the N1 highway in Pretoria earlier in June. Police say he is possibly armed and is considered dangerous. Niel Pieter Van Zyl, 39, was arrested after police intercepted a bakkie towing a Ski Boat with 800 Kilograms of cocaine. Another three suspects Rafiek Baderoen, 44, Rashied Baderoen, 48 and Michael Norman, 38, were arrested in Cape Town. They will be appearing in the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Monday. It is believed that this drug syndicate stockpiles large quantities of cocaine before exporting it to other countries from South Africa. Isa is also wanted on an Interpol Red Notice issued in Belgium on charges of Dealing in Cocaine and Money Laundering. He has been using a number of alias names and was last seen in Camps Bay, Cape Town. Isa evaded arrest in his Cape Town residence earlier this month, when three of his alleged accomplices were nabbed. #sapsHQ Three additional suspects arrested in Cape Town linked to R400 Million worth of drugs uncovered on the N1 in Pretoria on 02/06 where a bakkie was towing a 12-foot ski boat wherein 800kg of compressed pure cocaine was found. #DrugsOffTheStreets NPhttps://t.co/nVwyya3EpB pic.twitter.com/yTK3YfaXd0 — SA Police Service  (@SAPoliceService) June 18, 2021
