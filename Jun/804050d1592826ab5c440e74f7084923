The City of Cape Town’s Mayco Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith, has called on the Western Cape Transport Department to invoke maximum powers to deal with the alleged criminal conduct of some public transport operators on the Cape Flats on Wednesday morning. Smith says at least seven vehicles, mostly private ones have been set alight in the Nyanga neighbourhood. Sporadic stone throwing incidents have also been reported. Several roads were closed during peak hour traffic. Smith says he has also called on senior staff in the municipality to intensify their operations in Nyanga and the adjacent areas. This morning’s turmoil was believed to be in reaction to a big operation in the area to stabilise the transport situation in the township. This happened as the torching of buses continues, allegedly by disgruntled taxi operators.
