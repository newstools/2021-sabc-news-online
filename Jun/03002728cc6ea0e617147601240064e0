The North West Social Development MEC, Boitumelo Moiloa, has called for a partnership between government and local communities in the fight against substance abuse. The interaction programme targets 1 480 people to receive substance use disorder services at state- run facilities. Almost 4 000 people will also be reached through substance abuse prevention programmes. World Drug Day, under the theme: “Share facts on drugs. Safe lives, was observed by the Department of Social Development in the North West on Monday. Substance abuse causes community disintegration, broken families and it increases the severity of poverty and violence. Moiloa’s department has established an In-Patient Treatment Centre, at Witrand Hospital in Potchefstroom to provide rehabilitation services to drug users. Other treatment centres will also be put into operation this year to provide similar services, including accommodation for homeless people. SABC News’ Sylvester Serame’s report on this:
