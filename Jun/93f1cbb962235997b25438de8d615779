EFF leader Julius Malema and his deputy Floyd Shivambu are expected to lead a march to the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority’s (SAHPRA) headquarters. Scores of EFF supporters have gathered in the Pretoria CBD ahead of the protest march. The party is demanding that the regulator speed up its approval of COVID-19 vaccines to curb the spread of the virus.  Some EFF members say they’re tired of wearing masks and they want vaccines to be made available for all citizens as a matter of urgency. EFF spokesperson Vuyani Pambo says SAHPRA has seven days to adhere to their demands or the party will stage a sit-in outside the house of SAHPRA’s CEO. https://t.co/MWM3Wdtye1 — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) June 25, 2021  EFF Calls On All People To Join The March To Demand Vaccines Tomorrow, Friday 25 June 2021 pic.twitter.com/7HPRi5RTz1 — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) June 24, 2021  SAHPRA to assess efficacy of Sinopharm vaccine Meanwhile, the health regulator said on Wednesday it had received documentation for China’s Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine and will evaluate the data to assess the efficacy of the shot.
