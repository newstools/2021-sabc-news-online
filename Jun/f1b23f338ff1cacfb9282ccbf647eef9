The State Capture Commission has heard that the Gupta-linked shell company, Homix, was paid more than R324 million from six various State capture contracts. Homix was flagged as a suspicious company by local auditing firm Deloitte and later its transactions flagged as suspicious by the Reserve Bank when it transferred funds to an offshore account in Hong Kong. In 2014, Homix scored almost R40 million for facilitating a deal between Transnet and Neotel, although it had done no work for the state entity. Director of investigations at Shadow World Investigations, Paul Holden has told the commission all funds Homix earned came directly from State-owned entities. Holden says, “The first entrant is Transnet, including contracts involving McKinsey, which pays a large number of funds into Regiments. The second is SA Express which also does the same, from Regiments between April 2014 and 2015 an amount of R175 516 583.48 is paid from those sources to Homix. And the Neotel contracts are in relation to contracts that were awarded from Transnet to Neotel.” VIDEO: State Capture hears Law Enforcement Agencies-related evidence: Success fees Last week, former Transnet CFO Anoj Singh said he doesn’t know why a Gupta-linked shelf company, Homix, was paid over R40 million in a success fee by Transnet for its role in facilitating a deal between the state-owned entity and telecoms firm Neotel. Singh said Neotel had a gun to their head because they owned the telecoms infrastructure at Transnet and were forced to renew their contract.
