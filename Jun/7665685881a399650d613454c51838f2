Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe says government has noted that load shedding presents a massive risk to the economy. The Minister says crucial steps had to be followed on the path to better energy supply. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a partial liberalisation of the energy sector on Thursday, lifting government’s limit on self-generation of power from one megawatt to 100 megawatts. Mantashe says the achievement of energy security is one of the key economic interventions in the recovery and reconstruction plan but concedes that it’s long overdue. “I’m interested in Eskom recovering, developing its capacity and doing well. Now when you run entities you must have rules and there will be chaos if you break these rules. That is why we took long engagement(s).” “When the President was twisting my arm l had to concede because you are a Minister, people who have ideas must put their ideas before you and your team reaches a particular determination,” says Mantashe. Mantashe was speaking on the SABC’s The Watchdog programme hosted by Vuyo Mvoko:  Meanwhile, Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) president Sipho Pityana says companies are willing to work with labour, government and civil society to assist in moving South Africa out of the energy crisis it currently faces. Pityana was responding to President Ramaphosa’s announcement of a partial liberalisation of the energy sector. Eskom is expected to continue with Stage three load shedding until the end of this week.
