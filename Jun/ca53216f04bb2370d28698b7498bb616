The Health Department’s Director General, Dr Sandile Buthelezi, says the health sector is better-prepared for further hospital admissions amid the third wave of the coronavirus. President Cyril Ramaphosa made the announcement on Tuesday night that the country had moved to lockdown level 3.  He has raised concerns over several provinces reporting a consistent rise in COVID-19 infections – with Gauteng being the worst hit.  Buthelezi says the health sector has taken lessons from the first and second wave of the coronavirus on ways to treat patients: “I think we have learned quite a lot from the 1st and 2nd waves. We have managed to navigate ourselves through it. It has not been easy, we have faced many challenges along the way. In terms of availability of beds, oxygen, staffing and equipment we are comfortable that as a country we will be able to manage. But, certain provinces are taking strain such as Gauteng. So, we will continue to monitor the situation.”
