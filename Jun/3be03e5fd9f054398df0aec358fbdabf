The Democratic Alliance (DA) has accused both Health Minister Zweli Mkhize and the department’s Director-General (DG) Sandile Buthelezi of undermining the role of Parliament. The Minister was expected to appear before the Portfolio Committee on Health on Friday. The Minister told the Portfolio Committee on Health that he’s been legally advised not to appear before the Committee to discuss the awarding of the R150 million Digital Vibes contract, while his DG said he’s been advised to refrain from commenting on the contract. This is after DA Member of Parliament, Siviwe Gwarube, opened a case against the two at the Cape Town Police Station. Gwarube’s colleague, Evelyn Wilson, rejected the African National Congress’ (ANC) position that the matter is subjudice, demanding answers. “It is not subject to subjudice, it is not before the court. The matter is not being heard in court and the DG agreed to come to this meeting. Why? Because is it not subjudice. We must remember one thing here, we are not accountable to the Minister or his DG, they are accountable to us,” says Wilson. Digital Vibes contract | DA lays criminal charge against Dr Zweli Mkhize: Siviwe Gwarube  ANC defends Mkhize The ANC has accused the DA of jumping the gun by opening a case against Mkhize and Buthelezi regarding the awarding of Digital Vibes tender. ANC MP Kenneth Jacobs puts the blame on Gwarube that the committee was unable to deliberate on the matter. “I want to reiterate that the member had jumped the gun to go and lay criminal charges, therefore, the DG and the Minister have the right to do what they are doing to make certain that they don’t infringe their rights according to the Constitution,” says Jacobs.
