The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Africa has increased by more than 30% in the past week. New infections rose by more than 52% as the third wave makes its wave across the continent including South Africa. WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus says he expects things to worsen due to the continued lack of COVID-19 vaccine supply to Africa and other low income regions. So far South Africa remains the leading country with higher infections in the continent, recording 10 510 new coronavirus (COVID-19) cases, representing a positivity rate of 20.5% and bringing the country’s total cases to 1 796 589. Gauteng accounts for most of the cases provincially, having recorded a total of 536 848 cases.
