Former Public Enterprises Minister, Malusi Gigaba will be returning to the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg on Monday, where he’s expected to continue to give his version about matters. These include claims that he had seen former president Jacob Zuma’s convoy heading to the Gupta compound in Saxonwold. His estranged wife, Norma Gigaba, had earlier testified that the Guptas would harass her husband, demanding that he made changes at state-owned entities like Eskom and Transnet. The commission will also hear Eskom-related evidence from the former Project Manager at Kusile power station, Abram Masango, and former Eskom Executive, Prishotham Govender, later in the afternoon. Bitterness, malice claims Last week, Gigaba told the commission that his now estranged wife, Nomachule, had testified against him at the State Capture Commission out of bitterness and malice. “That anger and bitterness about not being able to extract more settlement prove that this is the person who came here to say when he was the minister he used to give me money. Now that he is no longer a minister and probably no longer has the ability to help me afford that type of lifestyle, I should therefore demand this lifestyle or a payment.” Gigaba says he never abused his power:  Nomachule Mngoma, in her recent testimony, said that the Gupta family had gifted Gigaba with jewelry, a vehicle and bags of cash, among others. “She does have money, lots of it. But this is a person who loves money and wants more of it and is angry that I cannot afford to spend all my future savings today [at the present moment] ,” adds Gigaba.
