The Executive Mayor of the City of Johannesburg, Geoffrey Makhubo, has received a positive test result for COVID-19. The City of Johannesburg says that as of today the Executive Mayor has gone into self-quarantine as part of the recovery process. The City of Johannesburg in a statement has urged residents to take the necessary non-medical precautions seriously and to ensure they wear masks, maintain social distance and limit movement in compliance with the Level-3 regulations currently in place. This as Gauteng and Johannesburg are officially in a third wave. The Mayor will continue to monitor and provide guidance on work currently being carried out to contain and manage the spread of COVID-19 in the City whilst in self-quarantine. Greater focus on Gauteng Meanwhile, a senior researcher at the CSIR, Dr. Ridhwaan Suliman, has recommended a greater focus on the situation at hospitals in Gauteng. Gauteng is regularly recording two-thirds of new coronavirus infections. It also has shown test positivity rates in excess of 20%. Dr. Suliman says in a tweet that hospitalizations in Gauteng have increased by a quarter and deaths from COVID are up 14%. People are urged to continue wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and regular handwashing to slow the spread of the virus. It is also recommended that poorly ventilated areas and crowds of people should be avoided.
