Protestors have again taken to the streets of Makhanda in the Eastern Cape barricading roads and leaving residents stranded. In May, residents and taxi operators shut down the town for three days to protest about the state of the roads and the lack of service delivery. They called off the protest action after the provincial government committed to work with the Makana Municipality to resolve the issues. Makhanda resident, Velisile Bukula says the protesters are preventing people from going to work and that they should rather air their grievances at the municipality. “Why are they not going there to close offices so there is no work to be done at municipal offices. The leadership that was sent by the premier to sort out the issues, failed. Because they should have gone to the people instead of having meetings with a few reps. They should have gone and addressed people so that they can see they are being recognised.” File video of May protests:
