President Cyril Ramaphosa says the reforms undertaken with regards to State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are to strengthen these institutions rather than weaken the public sector or to reduce its role. In his weekly letter to the nation, Ramaphosa has referred to the restructuring of Eskom and Transnet saying this is intended to make the public sector a more dynamic and effective part of the economy. Ramaphosa says government believes in public ownership of critical sectors of the economy and therefore it is important to turn SOEs around by rooting out corruption and improving governance. The President says state-owned enterprises (SOEs) should be at the forefront of economic and social transformation and fulfill their developmental mandate. He says government will not apply a blanket policy to reforming these institutions but will be guided by what is most appropriate to each on a case by case basis. The President says these interventions will encourage greater private investment in the countryâ€™s economic infrastructure and enable SOEs to become more efficient and competitive.
