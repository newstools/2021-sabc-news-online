The ANC Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) in the North West has disbanded the party’s regional executive committee in the Ngaka Modiri Molema district municipality with immediate effect. The IPC says the regional structure was disbanded after an assessment of its functions was conducted. This after some regional leaders took the IPC to court again, but their application was dismissed with costs. ANC IPC member Hlomane Chauke says, “The IPC having consulted with the national leadership has come to a conclusion to disband the region of Ngaka Modiri Molema with immediate effect- and to establish an interim structure that will run the affairs of the region. This in preparing for our branches to go to the BGM’s (branch general meeting) including BBGM’s (branch biennual general meeting)that will lead in regional conference including the preparations for the provincial conference.” AUDIO: Hlomane Chauke about disbanding the regional executive committee in the Ngaka Modiri Molema district
