Limpopo’s Education department has condemned the spilling of learners’ food at several schools in the Mankweng area, east of Polokwane. A group calling itself Business Forum, allegedly spilled school nutrition food for the learners as it is demanding tenders to supply food. The images of the spilled food have been circulating on social media. The Business Forum is yet to comment. Department Spokesperson, Tidimalo Chuene, says it is worrying that the incidents happened during Child Protection Week. “Quite a sad experience that this is happening during the Child Protection Week and we should be very worried if we have such people in our communities; people who can go to a point of spilling food that children are expecting to eat. The forum was engaged by the representatives from the department earlier in the month and they were advised on how they can do business with the schools and that’s why we are appalled and condemn in the strongest possible terms their recent actions,” says Chuene.
