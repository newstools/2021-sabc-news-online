The SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) will on Friday conduct a site inspection of the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital to assess its readiness to admit patients again. This comes a day after the Gauteng government announced that sections of the hospital would re-open immediately. The facility was gutted by fire in April – forcing a total shutdown.  Its reopening will boost the bed capacity in a province that remains the worst affected by the third wave of COVID-19 infections. In the latest data, Gauteng recorded 9 521 new daily cases. That’s around 60% of all cases reported nationally. On Wednesday it set a new daily record of close to 11 000 new infections.
