The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape has called on the national Health Department to open up vaccine registrations to people aged 40 and older. Currently, under phase two of the country’s vaccination programme, vaccines are only available to healthcare workers and people who are 60 years and older. DA Spokesperson for Health in the province, Wendy Philander, says provinces will have a better estimation of qualifying residents once people are allowed to register. “At this stage, 60 year olds are also still registering, but in opening up the system for the next targeted group, we can overcome the delays and challenges during registration as experienced at the start of phase 2a,” Philander says. “This further promotes the supply-demand chain which is key to starting an efficient phase 2b. The extent and severity of the third wave very much depends on an efficient vaccination drive,” adds Philander. Vaccination registration open for persons 60 years and older:  Vaccination of educators  The DA’s call comes as government gears up for the vaccination of educators and support staff in the country, which is scheduled to start on Wednesday. The vaccination programme is expected to end on July 8, 2021. All teachers, admin staff, and cleaners regardless of age, are urged to get the J & J vaccine.
