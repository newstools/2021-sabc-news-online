Britain says it’s looking at easing travel restrictions, including allowing those who had received two doses of the COVID-19 to enjoy a foreign holiday without intrusive red tape. Countries in the European Union (EU) last week agreed to an easing of travel restrictions over summer that will allow fully vaccinated tourists to avoid tests or quarantines and broaden the list of EU regions from which it is safe to travel. More than half of adults in Britain have received two doses of the vaccine. They will be allowed to avoid quarantine on their return from amber list countries, although they will still have to be tested. Countries on the amber list include Spain, France, Italy and the United States. Last week British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the final stage of easing lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom will be delayed until July 19, 2021. The delay comes amid rising cases of coronavirus infections due to the increase in the more transmissible COVID-19 Delta variant first identified in India, which scientists warn could trigger a third wave of infections in the country. Johnson says he is confident that the delay will not be longer than four weeks. “On travel abroad, I think that the most important thing is a follow up on the red amber green guidance, given that continually viewed that’s important. I wouldn’t want to give any more guidance than that at this stage opening up everything on the 19th July,” says Johnson.
