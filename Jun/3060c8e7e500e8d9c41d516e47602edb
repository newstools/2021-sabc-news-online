Police are monitoring the situation at Richards Bay Minerals on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. This after several heavy-duty graders and cranes were set alight by unknown suspects on Friday. In May, RBM’s general manager for operational services, Nico Swart, was shot and killed on his way to work. Department of Community Safety spokesperson Gugu Sisilana says the incident is being investigated. “MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Neliswa Peggy Nkonyeni, strongly condemns the act of violence and the destruction of property at Richards Bay Minerals, after several machineries were set alight.” “The situation at RBM is stable and a heavy law enforcement contingent has been deployed to monitor the situation. No injuries or fatalities were reported during the incident and RBM is still assessing the extent of the damage in order to quantify the financial losses that the company has incurred,” says Sisilana.
