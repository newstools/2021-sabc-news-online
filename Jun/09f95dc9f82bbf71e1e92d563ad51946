The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) has expressed satisfaction with the Basic Education Department’s vaccine rollout programme in the sector. Over the weekend Minister Angie Motshekga announced that all employees of the department including teachers, admin staff and cleaners will receive the Johnson and Johnson single-dose jab in the next two weeks. However, Sadtu General Secretary Mugwena Maluleke says they have some concerns. “The concerns that we have received so far in KZN are basically in terms of communicating with the principals because the contact person in the schools is the principal.” “The other concern basically again is that they have not totally identified those particular centres that are for vaccinations as agreed between the Department of Health and the Department of Education,” added Maluleke. Start of the education sector vaccine programme:  DOE warns against disruption of vaccine rollout The Basic Education Department says those who plan to disrupt the vaccine rollout which starts on Wednesday, will face the full might of the law. Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says it would be irresponsible for anyone to disrupt the vaccination processes. “It’s just irresponsible for some people to be making calls that go against what everybody has wished to see happen which is to get vaccinated so that we can stay healthy. If people want to disrupt we will call the police, they will get arrested. They will have to face the full might of the law. There is nothing that we can do, the law is very clear.”
