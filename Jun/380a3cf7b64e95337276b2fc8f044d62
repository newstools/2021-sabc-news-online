Gauteng Premier David Makhura says the vaccination of law enforcement personnel will start from July 1. He was speaking while presenting his officeâ€™s budget vote during a virtual sitting of the Gauteng Legislature. The vaccination of teachers started on Wednesday with over 10 000 teachers already vaccinated in Gauteng. Makhura says there are over 585 000 people in the province, the majority of whom are health workers at over 197 000. About 73 000 people over the age of 60 years have so far been vaccinated. Makhura says they will now move to vaccinate those over the age of 50 and law enforcement officials. The Gauteng Command Council is expected to brief the media soon to give an update on COVID-19 in the province. Gauteng is the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, as the third wave tightens its grip on the country. The province recorded 10 806 new cases in the last 24 hours.
