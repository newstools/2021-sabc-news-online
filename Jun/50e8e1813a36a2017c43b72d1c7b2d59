South Africa is back to lockdown level three this morning amidst rising concerns about a spike in the daily number of coronavirus infections, especially in Gauteng. In his address to the nation last night President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the curfew has been extended from 10pm in the evening until 4am in the morning. Non essential establishments like restaurants must close at nine in the evenings. Gatherings are now limited to 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors. Alcohol sales for offsite consumption are now only allowed between 10am in the morning and 6pm in the evening from Monday to Thursday. Ramaphosa says the measures are necessary as the country is in the third wave of infections.  Meanwhile, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Research and Innovation, at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Professor Mosa Moshabela has aired his views on the latest lockdown restrictions.
