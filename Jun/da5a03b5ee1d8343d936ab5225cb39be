The United Arab Emirates Ambassador to South Africa, Mahash Alhameli, has confirmed that his country has ratified an extradition treaty with South Africa that will ensure that the Guptas are brought back to South Africa to answer to allegations of state capture. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had announced that it had asked Interpol to assist with arrest warrants for Atul and Rajesh Gupta as well as their wives. The Guptas are believed to have fled to the UAE in early 2018 as criminal investigations for alleged corruption accelerated. Interpol arrest warrant for Guptas:  The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation will be staging a picket at the UAE embassy in Pretoria tomorrow. Neeshan Bolton the Executive Director at the Foundation explains “We welcome the fact that finally the extradition treaty has been signed. Last week, the ambassador said to me that there were some technical issues, mainly from the South African side. The South African government was saying to us that the problem was on the UAE side. We were not too sure where exactly the problem was but, in any event, we’re happy that this agreement has now been signed. The demonstration was obviously planned well before this agreement was announced. It will go ahead and the reason why it will go ahead is that it’s one thing for the UAE to sign but more is required from them.” Gupta associate denied bail Yesterday businessman and Gupta family associate, Iqbal Sharma, was denied bail by the Bloemfontein Magistrate Court.
