The nine-year-old Zimbabwean boy who was severely disfigured after a hyena attack has arrived in South Africa for reconstructive surgery. Rodwell Nkomazana was at a night church service in rural Masvingo – south of the capital, Harare – when the wild animal attacked him. He’s lost one of his eyes, his nose, and parts of his mouth during the attack.

Nkomozana’s doctor in Harare, Wayne Munana, says the Grade three pupil will need several operations. SABC International News Editor Sophie Mokoena has more on the story in the video below
