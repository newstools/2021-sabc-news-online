Final preparations are being made to an area outside the Durban High Court where supporters of former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede will gather. Gumede and 21 other accused are due to appear in court on Monday, on charges of fraud and corruption in connection with a Durban Solid Waste tender of over R400 million in 2017. Case against Zandile Gumede and 21 others moved to the Durban High Court:  The tent and stage where supporters will wait outside court has been set up. Security has been beefed up around the High Court. Spokesperson for Gumede supporters Ntando Khuzwayo says the group outside court will abide by COVD-19 regulations. Meanwhile, in March it was reported that according to the indictment, the State listed Robert Abbu, accused number one, amongst the key role players. Former supply chain manager at the eThekwini Municipality Sandile Ngcobo, senior African National Congress (ANC)Â councillor Mondli Mthembu, former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede and suspended eThekwini City Manager Sipho Nzuza are also listed as key players in the matter. Details contained in the indictment state that Abbu, in 2017, was appointed by Nzuza as Head of Special Projects without following proper procedures, a position that the State alleges had not previously existed.
