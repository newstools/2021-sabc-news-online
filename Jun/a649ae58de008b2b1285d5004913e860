Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo says former president Jacob Zuma’s refusal to appear before the commission will not affect its findings on the extent of corruption in government. Zondo’s statement comes after the Constitutional Court sentenced Zuma to 15 months in jail for contempt of court, violating the authority of the court and repeatedly attacking the dignity of the judiciary. Zuma has until Sunday to present himself to a police station either in Nkandla in northern KwaZulu-Natal or in Johannesburg. If Zuma fails to do so, the Police Minister and the National Commissioner of Police must ensure that he is delivered to prison authorities. 15-month jail sentence for Zuma:  Zondo addressed the media in Johannesburg in response to the judgment against Zuma. “It would have been better to have had Mr Zuma appear before the commission and making himself available for questioning. But the commission has called before it a number of witnesses who’ve given evidence. So I’m satisfied that in the end, the commission will be able to make clear findings based on the evidence that it has heard,” says Zondo. Zondo says the Constitutional Court’s judgment against Zuma has vindicated the country’s rule of law and the Constitution as well as reaffirmed the principle that all are equal before the law. Former President Jacob Zuma contempt case judgment:  Zondo told the media that the judgment underlined the importance of accountability in a constitutional democracy. “We welcome the judgment. We think the judgment is of great importance in our constitutional democracy. It vindicates the rule of law in our country. It vindicates the supremacy of our constitution. It reaffirms the principle that we are all equal before the law. It underlines the importance of accountability in our constitutional democracy,” says Zondo.
