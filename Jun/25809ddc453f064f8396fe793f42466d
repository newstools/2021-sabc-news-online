The South African Medical Association (SAMA) has appealed for the public to ensure COVID-19 protocols are followed, requesting that people observe social distance and wear masks when visiting each other’s homes. SAMA’s Chairperson, Angelique Coetzee says several members of the public are failing to adhere to COVID- health protocols. “We need to look at getting people back in their houses without a lot of people around them. And if you have your family members coming to visit you or anyone else coming to visit you at home, you have to open up your windows, stay 1.5 meters away and wear a mask. We still see infections coming from funerals, people flying nationally and our public transport is also going to increase the numbers of people infected. “ The association has also called on the government to enforce stricter lockdown measures saying some members of the public are not adhering to COVID-19 health protocols. SAMA calls for stricter lockdown measures:  South Africa is currently operating under adjusted Lockdown Level 2  amid the third wave of the coronavirus in parts of the country. The Health Department has recorded more than 5 000 new daily cases for a third consecutive day, taking the country’s tally to 1 686 041 cases since the start of the pandemic. “We would urge and I know I have been criticised for asking for stricter lockdowns or curfews over the weekend but the truth of the matter is that people don’t listen anymore and we need to protect the average person out there who is doing things correctly. But unfortunately, when they get into a place where other people are – in confined spaces like taxis or busses – all that work where someone doesn’t wear their mask, they can get the infection,” says SAMA’s Chairperson  Dr. Angelique Coetzee.

Bars and restaurants close by 10 pm with gatherings limited to 100 indoors and 250 outdoors. Addressing the nation last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa said where the venue is too small to accommodate these numbers with appropriate social distancing, no more than 50% of the capacity of the venue may be used. The President urged owners and managers of public buildings, centres, shops, restaurants, taxis, and buses to ensure that people on their premises or in their vehicles wear masks and that the appropriate social distancing measures are in place.
