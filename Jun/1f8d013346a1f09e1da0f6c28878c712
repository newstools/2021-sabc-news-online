MKMVA President Kebby Maphatsoe reiterated his stance that uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association is not disbanded. Maphatsoe was addressing the MKMVA Johannesburg Regional General Council in Johannesburg on Sunday. Last week, African National Congress (ANC) officials announced the dissolution of the MKMVA and the uMkhonto weSizwe National Council. The ANC’s top brass also said a new formation led by members of the Luthuli Detachment will emerge with the responsibility of taking the two bodies to a unity conference. No joy for former combatants who sacrificed for the struggle:  However, on Sunday Maphatsoe told dozens of former ex-MK combatants that the ANC has no power to disband them. Members of the embattled MKMVA say the ANC under Cyril Ramapahosa has disbanded any structure that is suspected of not supporting the President’s faction. They have vowed to challenge anyone in court who dares to disband their association. Kebby Maphatsoe denies speculation the MKMVA has been disbanded:   Speaking to SABC News earlier in June, Maphatsoe said discussions to disband the MKMVA and the MK Council were not yet finalised. The MK Council had proposed to the top officials of the ANC to dismantle the MKMVA and form one single military veteran’s entity to represent all former ANC liberation fighters. MKMVA deeply aggrieved by the collapseed meeting with the ANC National Office Bearers, and announces that we will not disband. pic.twitter.com/sNmOdOPfN1 — Carl Niehaus (@niehaus_carl) June 14, 2021
