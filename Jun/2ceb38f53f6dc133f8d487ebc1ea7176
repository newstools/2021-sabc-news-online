About 20 bodies believed to be those of illegal mine workers have been brought to the surface at an unused mine outside Orkney in the North West. This follows unconfirmed reports over the weekend that a number of illegal miners had died in an explosion underground. Five bodies were initially found in the area and another 15 have since been recovered. A number of mines have been left abandoned in the area in the past few years. Police spokesperson Sabata Mokgwabone says: “We can confirm that twenty bodies were removed from one of the shaft in the area of Orkney the bodies are not yet identified and we are continue with crime scene investigations we are going to open cases of inquests at this stage like I said we are still continuing with investigations we will reveal information after getting what really transpired or led to this particular incident.” Update on discovered bodies at an old unused Orkney mine:
