The case against a 24 year-old Zimbabwen woman accused of killing her baby has been postponed by the Middelburg Magistrate’s Court in Mpumalanga. This after it emerged in court today that the woman has been admitted to hospital. Everjoy Masuku, accused of killing her three-month-old baby, was expected to apply for bail. It is alleged that Masuku and her daughter visited the baby’s father at Avontuur near Middelburg, last week. The father allegedly refused to let them inside the house. She reportedly threatened to kill their baby if he does not open the door. She allegedly threw the baby on the ground. Paramedics certified the baby dead upon arrival.
