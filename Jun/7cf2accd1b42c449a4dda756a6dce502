Congress of Traditional leaders of South Africa (Contralesa) has called on government not to impose harsher laws on initiation practices. They were reacting to the signing into law of the long-awaited Customary Initiation Act by President Cyril Ramaphosa last week. It is aimed at stopping abuse at initiation schools and saving lives through the implementation of measures such as the registration of initiation schools and traditional surgeons. Kgoshi Mothupa Mokoena on SAfm’s Sunrise show:  Contralesa President, Kgoshi Mothupa Mokoena says they are against the idea that medical practitioners should supervise traditional surgeons. “We made many submissions trying to support government in terms of this legislation, unfortunately, all our inputs were thrown out of the window. What we asked before is that our traditional surgeons let them be retrained by someone who knows this culture. Now to say there would be trained by a medical doctor or supervision of a medical doctor, hello, what if that doctor doesn’t know this culture. We advised government on many occasions that please our government we respect you don’t legislate on something that you cannot enforce.”
