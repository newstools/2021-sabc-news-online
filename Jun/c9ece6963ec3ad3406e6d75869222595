The crucial Eskom wage negotiations are now headed for arbitration following yet another deadlock, this time under the auspices of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA). The labour dispute resolution body failed to broker a deal between the parties during a conciliation meeting last week. Two weeks ago, Eskom management took everyone by surprise when it abruptly pulled the plug on wage negotiations with unions. And, in an unprecedented move, management declared a dispute with the unions at the CCMA, triggering a mediation process that was supposed to last for a maximum of 30 days. But it took just one sitting at the CCMA for the talks to collapse once again and the unions were issued with a certificate of non-resolution. Ordinarily, a certificate of non-resolution gives unions the right to embark on a protected strike. But, Eskom workers are not allowed to strike because the power utility is designated as an essential service. Hence, the decision to go for arbitration. The NUM and Numsa began the wage negotiations demanding a 15% wage increase, while Solidarity demanded 9.5%. The NUM, which is the majority union, has since revised its demand down to 5%. It will be up to the Arbitrator now to decide the percentage increase for Eskom’s 48 000 employees. That decision will be final and binding on all parties.
