The ANC national leadership is expected to announce tough measures against all its deployees in the North West, who are allegedly continuing to defy the party’s Interim Provincial Committee’s instructions. Those affected include members in different municipalities, the provincial legislature, and the executive council. The decision by the party’s top brass was taken during the National Working Committee’s visit to the province at the weekend. ANC Acting Spokesperson Dakota Lekgoete says the party will soon announce its decision. “Heads are going to roll. I must be honest that we are going to be hard, anybody who has defied the IPC, anybody who had defied the ANC we are going to act harshly against them. Amongst things that we are going to pronounce ourselves on, are possible changes in a number of our municipalities as well as in the provincial government – and that is why we had to take hard decisions which are going to disappoint some, which are going to make some happy.” Coordinator for the ANC IPC, Hlomane Chauke, says they agreed with the national leadership to give those affected until next week to comply with the party’s instructions. “With the visit which is now the fourth visit by the NWC led by the president, on this defiance that we are dealing with and hence we have taken a decision as the IPC that all those comrades that are affected to resign. We have given them until month-end and month-end we will then again deal with any other defiance. But this time around I will take it that the defiance will then be dealt with by the national leadership.” Recalled ANC deployees refuse to step down in the North West:
