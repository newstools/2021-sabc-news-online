Some experts have warned of possible further election postponements if the October Local Government Elections (LGE) are postponed. Head of the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa,Â Grant Masterson says postponing an election could set the wrong precedence. He was speaking at the inquiry into the feasibility of holding the Local Government Election, chaired by Justice Dikgang Moseneke. Moseneke has raised concerns on potential low turn out should the country forge ahead with the October election. He warns a low turn out on elections day for the local government election, could pose a risk to the democracy project. Moseneke drew examples from a recent election on the continent that had to be nullified due to a low voter turn out. Other concerns raised was the freeness and fairness of elections without the traditional election campaigning.
