Members of the Ga-Phaahla traditional council, including chief Letsiri Phaahla, have staged a sit-in at the Makhuduthamaga municipal offices at Jane Furse in Limpopo. They are demanding the electrification of 322 households at Madikwe village, which they say the municipality has been promising to electrify since 2015. They are also demanding to meet with Mayor Minah Bahule. The municipality is yet to comment. Chief Phaahla has accused the Mayor of failing the community. “If it means we are going to be here for a week, we will be here for a week until we get answers from her. This is the Mayor that is being praised all over, left, right and centre. But according to us as Phaahla people, we don’t see anything that reflects those praises that she is being showered with. Because there is nothing that came from our village in the form of a request that was forwarded to her office that she ever attended, not even a single matter, because this thing that we see now is total disrespect.”
