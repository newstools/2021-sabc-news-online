The non-profit organisation, mothers2mothers, will be participating in a high-level meeting on HIV/AIDS on Tuesday and Wednesday at the UN Headquarters in New York. The organisation employs women living with HIV as frontline health workers who deliver services and education to those living with HIV and to help prevent new infections. The organisation was founded in Cape Town and now works across ten African nations. President and CEO of mothers2mothers, Frank Bradley de Palomo, says they are concerned about the new data from UNAIDS released last week, that shows that HIV prevention progress has stalled, especially among children in Sub-Saharan Africa. A concerning new report from @UNAIDS shows that progress to #endAIDS in children has stalled. For the first time in over a decade, we’re seeing a slight rise in new #HIV infections in children in sub-Saharan Africa.
