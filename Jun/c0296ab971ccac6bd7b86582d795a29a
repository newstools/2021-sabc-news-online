The Eastern Cape Liquor Board has clamped down on four illegal liquor outlets in Ugie. The board acted after media reports that the taverns were operating too close to schools and selling alcohol to school children. Three of the taverns were closed while the police found no liquor on the premises of the fourth tavern during the raid. The spokesperson for the provincial liquor board Mgwebi Msiya, says there are 7 500 registered liquor outlets in the province. Msiya says they will continue to close non-compliant liquor outlets. “There is quite a number of people that are selling alcohol illegally that do not have a liquor licence. The reported case of liquor outlets that sell alcohol to school children in that area of Ugie. So they found four such liquor outlets and they closed them down and confiscated their liquor, so we are really after them. We want to make sure that no one sells alcohol without a liquor licence,” says Msiya.
