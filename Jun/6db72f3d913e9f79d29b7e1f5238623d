Suspended Manager for Supply Management at the South African Civil Aviation Authority, Mbulelo Gingcana, says he did not know nor had ever met former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi before he appeared at the State Capture Commission. In his testimony to the commission, Agrizzi alleged that Gingcana received security installations from Bosasa free of charge at his home to the tune of R240 000 in March 2017. Agrizzi says this was part of the company’s special operations aimed at nurturing high-profile individuals. However, Commission evidence leader Refiloe Molefe outlines the affidavit of Bosasa employee Richard Le Roux who disputes Gingcana’s evidence. “Mr Richard Le Roux says that firstly, you are not being honest in denying that you know or spoke to Mr Agrizzi. He says he was present at the house on a Saturday afternoon when both Mr Agrizzi and Mr Dlamini had a meeting with you and that he, that being Mr Richard Le Roux, waited outside the premises and only when he was requested to go in to do a survey of the house after the meeting concluded. He says he specifically remembers this as Mr Agrizzi came to get him in a gold Maserati and went with him to the house in order to do a survey of what security equipment is needed.” Commission hears Bosasa-related evidence from Mbulelo Gingcana:
