The African National Congress (ANC) in the North West has confirmed the passing of member of the Interim Provincial Committee and former Education MEC Reverend Johannes “OJ” Tselapedi. Tselapedi was among three names submitted to lead the ANC following Supra Mahumapelo’s resignation as Premier of the North West in 2018. Spokesperson for the ANC Interim Provincial Committee is Kenny Morolong says, “Comrade OJ, as he was popularly known, passed on this morning after a short illness. Comrade OJ was a decorated freedom fighter, a veteran of the movement, an outstanding leader of the people. He had diligently served the movement in many capacities, including as former deputy chairperson of the ANC in the North West province.” By the time of his passing, he was a member of the interim provincial committee of the ANC in the North West. He served as a speaker of NWPL, MEC of Agriculture and MEC of Education in the province. Chief Whip Paul Sebego says, “We are deeply pained by the demise of such an all-rounder of our movement, the death of Tselapedi means that we have yet again lost a reservoir from which we can access important advice and counsel on how best to navigate our path in difficult situations.” The party sends its heartfelt condolences to his immediate family, comrades who have struggled side by side with him, the church which he led, and the people of the North West province to whom he dedicated his life and served with the greatest humility.
