Seven people have been shot dead outside a home in Gugulethu in Cape Town. They were apparently killed execution style. Arrive Alive says Netcare 911 responded to reports of a shooting. Five men sustained fatal injuries after being shot in the head. Two others sustained serious wounds and died in hospital. The police in the Western Cape say they have instituted the 72 Activation Plan for the mobilisation of resources in search of gunmen. Reports indicate that the victims were attending a traditional ceremony. “Organised crime detectives are probing the seven murders. Anyone with information that could assist the investigation is urged to contact the police on 08600 10111. The identities and ages of the deceased persons will be released once their next of kin are informed,” say the police in a statement. The motive for the shooting incident is yet to be determined. Western Cape Acting Provincial Commissioner , Major General Thembisile Patekile, says police teams are already pursuing several leads. “The teams will work through the night conducting tracing operations”, says Major General Patekile. The area is notorious for shootings. In November, seven people were also killed by an unknown group in the township. SABC News reporter Mariska Botha elaborates on that case in the video below:
