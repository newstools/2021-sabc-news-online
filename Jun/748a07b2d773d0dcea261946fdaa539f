The Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) has become the first institution of higher learning in the country to open up a dedicated COVID-19 vaccination centre for its staff and students. Staff members from the faculty of health and wellness sciences, campus health clinics and the HIV/Aids unit have been trained to administer the vaccines. CPUT spokesperson, Lauren Kansley, says those who are 60-years-old or older at the university are currently eligible and can be vaccinated at the centre, as well as staff members who are healthcare workers. “The centre will cater exclusively to the needs of about 40 000 student and staff members. It is able to vaccinate about 500 people per day when working at capacity. The centre is located at our Bellville Campus and is staffed by CPUT staff members who are also health workers. The vaccination centre has been accredited by the Western Cape Department of Health,” explains Kansley. COVID-19 cases rise by 4 209 and deaths by 120:  Meanwhile, the Department of Health in the Western Cape says there has been a 23% increase in COVID-19 cases on the Garden Route in the last week. Health District spokesperson Nadia Ferreira says all sub-districts had significant increases, except for Bitou and Knysna which have decreased and Kannaland which remained unchanged.
