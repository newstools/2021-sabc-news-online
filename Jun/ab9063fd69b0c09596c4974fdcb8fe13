Scientists analysing stones that attracted scores of people at KwaHlathi near Ladysmith will on Sunday report on their findings whether the stones are really precious. Thousands of people flocked to the area in the past few weeks digging the stones they believed to be diamonds. KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says scientists and relevant government departments decided to analyse the stones. “We welcome the deployment of the delegation made up of geoscientists, government officials and other interested parties to KwaHlathi early this week. Today, a delegation from the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will engage with stakeholders and will together pronounce on the outcome today at 16h00 pm. This will bring certainty for the people on whether this is indeed precious stones or something else.” Retired geologist from Durban, Manqoba Msimango, says he can not rule out the authenticity of the recent discovery of what some believe to be diamonds. People flocked to the area, some even from other provinces, to mine the stones. The provincial government had earlier expressed concerns about the activities and has asked the provincial Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs to refer the matter to the national Department of Minerals and Energy to do inspections at the site.
