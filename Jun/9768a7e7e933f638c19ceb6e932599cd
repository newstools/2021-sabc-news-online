Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says the early closure of schools will help increase the vaccination of employees in the education sector. Motshekga is in the Northern Cape to monitor the vaccine roll-out program of teachers, admin and support staff. So far the Northern Cape Education Department has vaccinated more than 3 000 employees out of their target of more than 16 000. “From Sunday, the Health Department has assured us that all the vaccines that we have requested have arrived so there won’t be any shortages. Thursday and Friday will even help us to ramp up even faster because we do not have children to look after, so teachers will come in their numbers. Now that we have the assurance of the availability of vaccines we are able to move faster” says Angie Motshekga.
