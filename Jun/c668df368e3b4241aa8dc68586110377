Eskom says it will implement Stage 2 load shedding from 10:00 on Wednesday morning until 22:00 on Sunday night. The power utility blames this on the continued delays in returning generation units to service at Duvha, Tutuka, Kusile, Kendal and Koeberg power stations. Stage 2 load shedding from 10:00 today:  Earlier this week, Eskom warned that the likelihood of load shedding remained high for the rest of the week as the power system remains constrained and vulnerable. Eskom has again called on South Africans to reduce their electricity usage.  #POWERALERT1 Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 10:00 this morning until 22:00 on Sunday
