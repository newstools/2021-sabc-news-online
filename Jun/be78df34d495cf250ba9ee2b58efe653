The fraud and corruption trial of former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede is expected to start on July 18, 2022 in the Durban High Court. Gumede is being charged together with 21 other accused which include business people, councillors and municipal officials. The case stems from a Durban Solid Waste tender of over R400 million in 2017. The court has postponed the case to November 30 for another pre-trial hearing. Gumede has appeared at the Durban High Court:  In March, it was reported that according to the indictment the State listed Robert Abbu, accused number one, amongst the key role players. Former supply chain manager at the eThekwini Municipality Sandile Ngcobo, senior African National Congress (ANC) councillor Mondli Mthembu, former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede and suspended eThekwini City Manager Sipho Nzuza are also listed as key players in the matter. Details contained in the indictment state that Abbu, in 2017, was appointed by Nzuza as Head of Special Projects without following proper procedures, a position that the State alleges had not previously existed.
