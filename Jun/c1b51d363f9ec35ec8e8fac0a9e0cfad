The North West Department of Local Government and Human Settlements has committed to building houses for the 12 families who were evicted from a farm near Ventersdorp in the North West. The group comprising of 51 members, including 20 children with all their belongings were evicted almost two months ago and were forced to spend two nights on the street. They are currently being accommodated in a community hall at Tshing township in Ventersdorp.  The department’s commitment comes after the Department of Land Reform succeeded in purchasing a 205 hectare farm in Hartebeesfontein near Klerksdorp worth R1.4 million. Chief Director for Human Settlements, Tshepo Phetlho, says they have already appointed service providers. “We looked at our programme and we said let us assist the 12 families that are evicted through a programme called the emergency housing programme. To that end, we then appointed service providers to do the same, which as we speak the service providers are on site. They started to construct houses and we are hoping that they will conclude soon.” Ward councillor in the Matlosana Local Municipality Mathapelo Seitisho says her municipality will also provide basic services to those evicted. “We will just provide our community with water, sanitation and also electricity because we are still using the temporary structures. Where there is a need for permanent structures, we will also be there.”
