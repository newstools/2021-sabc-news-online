Eskom says the inclement weather in the greater Cape Town area and parts of the Western Cape has caused an increase in electrical faults. In a statement, Eskom says severe weather conditions may put the network at risk and can potentially cause electricity outages. It says the weather conditions also affect the restoration times. Eskom says they will prioritise their response based on the size and duration of the outages. They’ve urged customers to download the Eskom app to log any electricity outages which can take up to 24-hours to be attended to. #EskomWesternCape #MediaStatement Inclement weather severely affecting the Eskom network in the

A strong cold front has made landfall with heavy rain, cold and windy conditions. Local Government Ministry spokesperson, James-Brent Styan, says two further cold fronts are expected on Thursday and Saturday. “The prediction from the SA Weather Service shows that this latest bout of cold wet weather which is set to move in from this week, is expected to continue until tonight, another storm and cold front are expected into Thursday morning, so this whole week the people can expect very cold, very wet weather. By Saturday another third cold front is expected. So certainly we expect to see a lot more rain.” Media Release: Several cold fronts expected in the Cape Provinces this week 28 June to 01 July 2021. pic.twitter.com/dEbMqXnRvY — SA Weather Service (@SAWeatherServic) June 26, 2021
