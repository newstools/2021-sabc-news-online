Gauteng Education Department says although they are experiencing a massive increase in the number of learners testing positive for COVID-19, they will await the provincial health department to advise on when they should close schools. Over 1000 learners are said to have tested positive at public schools in the province in the past week. The province is already experiencing the third wave with an average rate of around 3 500 new infections recorded each day. “We can confirm that a growing number of children in our schools are testing positive for COVID-19. We are monitoring the situation very closely, where it is recommended by the department of health for us to close schools. For now, they are closed for 3 days. We are concerned about the numbers and saying everyone has a role to play to stop the spread,” says  Gauteng Education Spokesperson Steve Mabona. South Africa has also recorded 182 new COVID-19 related fatalities on Friday, which brings the total number of deaths to 57 592.
