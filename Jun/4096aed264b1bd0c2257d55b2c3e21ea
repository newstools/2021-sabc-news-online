Jabu, rest in peace. Just the other day @DrEarlsPearls and I were driving past a restaurant we took #JabuMabuza & his wife #Siphiwe to. We reminisced about that lovely night and how Jabu had us laughing all night. pic.twitter.com/1yFuVzIcsG — Felicia Mabuza-Suttle (@Feliciamabuza) June 17, 2021  “The lawyer with a big voice. You must use that voice to scare people, right?” That was your standard way of greeting me Bra Jabu. Your sense of humour and laughter will be missed. Thank you for being an amazing inspiration. May your great soul rest in power. #JabuMabuza pic.twitter.com/Cnvwn6FZGu — Bongani Khoza (@BonganiKhoza07) June 17, 2021  #JabuMabuza Born bred & buttered at WatervalBoven, had a stint here in Mbombela b4 moving 2 Daveyton… I was happy 4 “One Of Us” when he was appointed as Eskom chair back in 2018…He was an inspiration and a role model to a lot of us here in MP… May his soul rest in peace pic.twitter.com/NF7VbTpbR6 — ARoseFrom A Concrete (@realMadumane) June 16, 2021
