Dismissed former African National Congress (ANC) councillors at the Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality, who are now councillors under the banner of MAP 16, have welcomed the Free State’s Interim Provincial Committee decision to review and set aside their 2018 expulsion from the party. The expelled councillors were accused of voting with the opposition in the removal of then-mayor Vusi Tshabalala. MAP 16 spokesperson Paratlane Motloung says this vindicates the dismissed members. However, Motloung says the gesture has come a little bit too late as they have moved on. Motloung says MAP 16 will continue to work tirelessly with the community of Maluti-A-Phofung. “So as MAP 16 we are on solid ground and we have a social pact with the community of Maluti-A-Phofung. Irrespective of what will happen going forward, they will stay with us and we will not go back into the ANC. So I safely reiterate that we are not going back to the ANC. We have moved on as former members of the ANC. We have this vibrant organisation that we are leading now so that is our stance going for now.”
