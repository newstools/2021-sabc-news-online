Frustration is growing as several residents from the KwaDukuza and iLembe Municipalities, north of Durban, have been left without water for six days. Ballito resident, Nel Sewraj, says water tankers have been dispatched, but only to a few areas. He says the prolonged disruption to water services poses a greater threat, as the country battles a looming third wave of COVID-19 infections. “There is a third wave of COVID-19 looming and you know, residents need to maintain hygiene, they need to maintain sanitation, we don’t want those levels to pick up for KZN(KwaZulu-Natal). Having water at this time is absolutely critical. What we have also seen is the plight of the elderly because some of the areas that have lost water, you know, the home of the aged and so forth. Though tankers have been dispatched now and then to them, how do you expect the elderly folk to carry water from the tankers to their homes,” says Sewraj. Meanwhile, in a statement, the iLembe District Municipality has attributed the water outage to cable theft, saying service providers are trying to locate and rectify the issue.
