Whether people are registered on the EVDS system or not. People who are 60 years and older can visit their nearest vaccination site. They will be registered and vaccinated. No one is to be turned away at our vaccination sites in Gauteng.” Vaccinations picking up On Tuesday during his address to the nation, President Cyril Ramaphosa says despite the setbacks with the COVID-19 vaccine roll out in the country, the pace is picking up with up to 85 000 people now being vaccinated daily. He says to date 2.4 million Pfizer vaccine doses have arrived in the country which will increase to 3.1 million by the end of the month. Government has also received an indication from Johnson and Johnson that the 2 million doses that had to be destroyed at Aspen’s plant in Gqeberha will be replaced by the end of the month. Ramaphosa says a statistic that provides hope is that only 64 healthcare workers have been infected in the last seven days compared to 640 at a similar point in the second wave. Announcing that South Africa was moving back to lockdown Level 3 on Tuesday night, Ramaphosa said the roll out will be boosted considerably over the next few weeks. “It is estimated that we have the capacity at present to vaccinate at least 150 000 people a day and we’re planning to increase that to 250 000 a day as soon as possible, I would prefer 300 000 a day, which we shall try and reach.”
