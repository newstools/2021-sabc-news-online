The 8th regional elective conference of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Mopani region in Limpopo has been postponed from this weekend to next weekend. The conference was scheduled to start on Friday. ANC in the Mopani’s regional Spokesperson, Sonia Ngobeni, says the conference has been postponed to finalize the adjudication of an appeal process and clear a verification report. “Our 8th regional conference was scheduled for the 11th to the 13th of this month. The conference has been postponed to the 18th until the 20th of June because of minor issues that have to be finalized. One of the adjudication of appeal processes was not concluded,” says Ngobeni.
