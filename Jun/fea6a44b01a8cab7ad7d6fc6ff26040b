Over 20 families of foreign nationals and some South Africans have been displaced after being forcefully removed from an old South African Post office building in Soweto. On Wednesday, angry Soweto residents stormed the unused building that was illegally being rented out. This happened while another protest was still under way at the Diepkloof police station that was organised by a group of residents calling themselves Dudula. The group wants to stop the hijacking of buildings and removal of illegal foreign-owned shops in the area. One of the evicted residents says they were not given notice. “They arrived here in the morning, banged on the gate and demanded to know who was staying here. After we told them that we live here, they told us to leave. It came as a surprise because we thought we would at least be given notice before being given marching orders. We asked them where will we go because we don’t have anywhere to go,” explains one of the people evicted. The video below is reporting on the eviction:
