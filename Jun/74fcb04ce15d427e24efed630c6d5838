A 30-year-old motorist will appear in the Giyani Magistrate’s court in Limpopo after he allegedly killed a bus passenger in an alleged road rage incident last Thursday. The victim was shot dead during an altercation between the suspect and the bus driver on the R81. The bus driver was unhurt. In another incident, a taxi driver was arrested for allegedly shooting and killing a man and his son on the N1 between Louis Trichardt and Polokwane two weeks ago. Police say the suspect also accidentally shot himself and is in hospital. Police spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo says they are concerned about the increasing number of road rage incidents. “Incidents of road rage that took place between a bus driver and another motorist, that took place along the R81 in the Giyani area in which a bus passenger was shot and killed by a 30-year-old motorist, is quiet disturbing as this is the second one following the one that took place at Bandelierkop recently. Road users are urged to be tolerant towards each other.”
