The Basic Education Department says those who plan to disrupt the vaccine rollout which starts on Wednesday, will face the full might of the law. The department is set to kick start the programme in all provinces with the Johnson and Johnson single-dose jab. Over the weekend, Minister Angie Motshekga announced that all employees of the department including teachers, admin staff and cleaners will receive the vaccine in the next two weeks. Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga says it would be irresponsible for anyone to disrupt the vaccination processes. “It’s just irresponsible for some people to be making calls that go against what everybody has wished to see happen which is to get vaccinated so that we can stay healthy. If people want to disrupt we will call the police, they will get arrested. They will have to face the full might of the law. There is nothing that we can do, the law is very clear.” Deputy CEO of the Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools Dr. Jaco Deacon encourages educators to get vaccinated:  Mhlanga says, “All provinces are expected to start today (Wednesday) with the vaccination. Those are the plans we have in place. We expect everyone to start today and most provinces have planned activities. Different provinces have different numbers of people, so they need to make sure that they share the information so that people know what to do, what to bring and when to go to the vaccination site.” Teachers across the country to be vaccinated from Wednesday:
