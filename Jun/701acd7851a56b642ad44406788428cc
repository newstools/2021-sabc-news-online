Minister of Mineral Resources Gwede Mantashe has confirmed that he will be visiting the site near Orkney in North West where the bodies of 20 suspected illegal mineworkers were found on Tuesday. The bodies, wrapped in white bags, were found in two different areas a few kilometers from each other. They were allegedly brought from underground by other illegal miners. According to the police the bodies had severe burn wounds and were already badly decomposed. The incident follows unconfirmed reports of an underground explosion. Police spokesperson, Sabata Mokgwabone, says they are not ruling out the possibility that more bodies might be found. “They are all male bodies and I can confirm that at this stage they are not yet identified and that they were badly decomposed and they had severe burn wounds. Our investigation is still under way and we hope that as we progress with investigations. We will be able to know who these people are and maybe as to what could have led to this particular incident.” 20 bodies believed to be that of illegal mineworkers in Orkney brought to surface:
