The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) in the Free State has welcomed the move to have teachers vaccinated. Education MEC Tate Makgoe has invited educators and support staff who would like to be vaccinated to come forward. This, as a surge in school infections has led to the temporary closure of many schools in the province. Sadtu says the option to vaccinate teachers comes at the right time, ahead of the resumption of daily attendance in primary school learners from next month. The union’s provincial secretary Bricks Moloi says the union will be at the forefront of advocating for teachers to avail themselves. Moloi says, “This is the news we have long been waiting for, considering the increasing infection rate in the province in particular amongst learners in schools and teachers. This is a relief on the part of the union and we believe that it is also the same on the part of the teachers and other education workers. Because of this anxiety, everyone was now skeptical about the learners coming in numbers.” Growing calls for more vaccination sites in Gauteng  Meanwhile, Gauteng leads the increase in COVID-19 infections, hospitalisations and deaths according to officials. COVID-19 vaccination drives within the province of Gauteng have seen a further 25 sites activated – as the third wave gains momentum bringing the number of sites across the province to 129.
