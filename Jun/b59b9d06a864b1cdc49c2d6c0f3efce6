Political analyst Susan Booysen says should suspended ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule win his court case against his party, it could potentially mean the end to the step aside resolution. The High Court in Johannesburg has committed to deliver judgment soon on the urgent application brought by Magashule to have his suspension declared unlawful and unconstitutional. Judge Jody Kollapen reserved judgment in the matter yesterday after hearing arguments from the legal representatives of Magashule and ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa alongside Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte. Booysen says Magashule has burned bridges as a result of this case. “It would be very difficult to resuscitate the step aside if that happens, but Ace Magashule is too tied into this, he has wrapped himself into this. It would be very difficult for him to argue and to come back with any credibility as the secretary-general of the ANC because those relationships have certainly been frozen over.” Magashule vs ANC court proceedings:  Magashule vs ANC court proceedings part 2:  “The matter was brought to court on the basis of urgency. We will try and finalise the judgment much sooner rather than later and I think I can speak on behalf of the bench and commit ourselves to do it as quickly as possible, minding that the application raises weighty issues of law. You can be assured that we will discharge our duties without fear, favour or prejudice,” said Judge Jody Kollapen. It now remains to be been seen whether Magashule’s bid to reverse his suspension will be successful.
