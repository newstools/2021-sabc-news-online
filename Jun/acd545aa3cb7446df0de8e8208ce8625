Some Durbanites in KwaZulu-Natal are calling for a stricter lockdown ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address tonight.  They are calling for a clampdown on inter-provincial travel and a ban on alcohol sales. These were some of the sentiments shared by some residents in Durban, “My expectations for our President is to do the responsible thing to look at provinces like Gauteng to have a bit of a harder lockdown, there shouldn’t be inter-provincial movement. Mr President, you need to do what’s right, stop people coming from Gauteng to Durban, the infection is rising and you need to do the right thing and you have a good committee you can make the right decision. We need to be responsible and we clearly expect booze banned and inter-provincial travel to be locked down. The fact that it’s spreading a lot quicker than the first wave means that we need to act swiftly with clear action.” Despite the COVID-19 vaccines now being rolled out to teachers across the country, some remain concerned about the amount of time that is being lost in the classroom due to the impact of the virus and the lockdown restrictions. Educator Carmin Carsado says,” I see that my children are starting to struggle in school and these lockdowns are affecting the learners. So our education system is really at high risk at the moment so I just hope that he keeps in mind the education of our country with these restrictions.” Reporter Vusi Khumalo speaks to people in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal:  Young Durbanites had mixed views on how schooling should be addressed in tonight’s address. “Children are fighting to play in lunch break they don’t want to sit and do nothing all lunch break, they don’t just want to sit in one place and social distance. Children should be free to play and have fun. Hope he doesn’t close down the schools because I like going to school and learning and seeing my friends. I want schools to close, I am sick of it,” says some of the school goers.
