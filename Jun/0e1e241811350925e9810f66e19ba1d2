Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has encouraged all those working in the education sector to make themselves available for vaccination as soon as possible. Lesufi was vaccinated on Wednesday morning at the Rabasotho Community Hall at Tembisa, on Johannesburg’s East Rand. The vaccination programme for the education sector was launched across the country today. It is expected to last around two weeks. In Gauteng, 125 000 employees at 46 sites are expected to get the single jab Johnson and Johnson vaccine. This includes principals, educators, and support staff. MEC Lesufi says the vaccination is crucial in order to return schools to normalcy. “We are targeting 125 staff members. We have incorporated everyone in the education sector. I’m feeling well after taking the vaccine. I want to send a strong message to or educators. It’s important for them to come here, even though vaccination is not compulsory but it is highly recommended. We want to ask all our teachers and staff members to take advantage of this opportunity so that the entire sector can be protected.” Gauteng Education MEC @Lesufi alongside @DBE_SA Minister Mrs Angie Motshekga and @HealthZA Deputy Minister Mr Joe Phaahla are joining the first group of educators at Rabasotho Community Centre in Tembisa who have heeded the call to #DropAllAndVaccinate pic.twitter.com/gCyNlpAmOT — Gauteng Department of Education (@EducationGP1) June 23, 2021  COVID-19 Vaccine rollout | Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi gets vaccinated:
