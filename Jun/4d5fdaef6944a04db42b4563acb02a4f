The case against a 76-year-old man accused of raping a 16-year-old girl from Warrenton in the Northern Cape has been postponed to July because the court is still awaiting DNA test results. The family has expressed anger over the continuous postponements since the traditional healer’s first appearance in January. The mother says it is heart breaking that the alleged perpetrator remains out on R500 bail, while they continue to suffer. “It is traumatising for us as the family of the victim to see the perpetrator happily and freely enjoying his life outside as if the offense of raping my daughter; not once but twice is taken lightly. As the family, we hope and pray that the truth will eventually prevail.” Meanwhile, judgment in a bail application by 26-year-old Johannes Bafana Mans is expected to be handed down on 12th July at the Kgomotso Magistrates’ Court at Taung in the North West. Mans was arrested in connection with the rape and murder of four-year-old Tshimologo Lotshabeng in late May. The girl’s body and clothes were found in bushes after she was allegedly raped before being killed. The suspect was arrested at his home at Jan Kempdorp in the Northern Cape. – Additional reporting by Sylvester Serame.
