Spokesperson of the National Health Department, Dr Lwazi Manzi, will leave her position to join the AU Commission on COVID-19. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced this on Monday, in his capacity as AU COVID-19 Champion. Dr Manzi was working under Dr Zweli Mkhize, who is currently on special leave, following a tender scandal. Mkhize has been accused of conflict of interest regarding a R150 million tender that his department awarded to communications company, Digital Vibes. The Presidency said the special leave period “will enable the Minister to attend to allegations and investigations concerning contracts between the Department of Health and a service provider, Digital Vibes”. Mkhize is being investigated by the Special Investigating Unit. Minister of Tourism, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, is serving as the Acting Minister of Health. However, the president says Manzi will represent Mkhize at the AU Commission on COVID-19. She will resume her duties as the Head of Secretariat of the AU Commission on COVID-19 on the first of July. pic.twitter.com/QCaFYyOxWn — Lwazi Manzi (@lwazimanzi) June 28, 2021  Dr Lwazi Manzi appointed as Head of Secretariat of the AU Commission on COVID-19:
