The Al Jamah political party is calling on President Cyril Ramaphosa to place the country back to Level 5 of the lockdown even if it’s for one or two weeks. This comes as the country enters the third wave of coronavirus infections with daily new infections rising steeply in a number of provinces. 114 5 552 12 223 448 83 304 1 611 447 1 752 630 1 669 326 14 ﻿June  2021 57 879 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Al Jamah Leader, Ganief Hendricks, says the country still remains in a coronavirus war zone. Hendricks also wants the sale of alcohol and cigarettes to be prohibited. “Al Jamah still feels today that we are in a war situation. For the past year, we supported the president with regards to each time of extending the state of Disaster, and we still supporting the President wherever we can. We are now in the third wave and people are dying like flies. And we feel that the President must ignore the official opposition party (DA) and focus on only saving lives. And he shouldn’t worry about saving livelihoods because we are in a war situation. We cannot let lives be lost just to save an extra job or two. So, Al Jamah’s position is that there should be a complete lockdown that we must move to level five, maybe just for a week or two, and secondly, there must be a complete alcohol ban because it has been proven that alcohol is causing much harm. And the President has given into the captains of the wine industry and that was the big mistake. We also feel that there must be a ban on cigarettes just like it was in level five. So we are in a war situation and we need to throw everything at defeating the pandemic,” says Hendricks.
