The Hawks and members from other police units have seized 541 kilograms of cocaine with an estimated street value of R243 million in Durban. The bricks of cocaine were in an imported container at a container depot in Isipingo – south of Durban. The consignment was marked as animal food. The investigation to apprehend those behind the drug smuggling is continuing. Hawks Spokesperson, Philani Nkwalase, says the national head of the Hawks – Godfrey Lebeya – praised the police team.

“He also said that we are closing in on the drug cartels. The drug bust shows that there are organised criminal groupings that are involved in organizing the movement of these dangerous dependency-producing substances from one country to another.” #sapsHQ KwaZulu-Natal: Cocaine weighing 541 kilograms with an estimated value of more than R243 MILLION were confiscated during a joint intell driven op at a container depot on Avenue East in Isipingo. #DrugTrafficking #DrugsOffTheStreets MEhttps://t.co/qAXihZ3QU0 pic.twitter.com/QJ1A3ebWpK — SA Police Service  (@SAPoliceService) June 22, 2021  Earlier in June, cocaine worth R400 million was confiscated on the N1 highway in Pretoria.
