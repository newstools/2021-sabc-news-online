The relatives of a woman who was brutally murdered in KwaMakhutha, south of Durban, say they are shocked and want justice. They believe that the motive behind her murder is because she was lesbian. The body of 28-year-old Anele Bhengu was discovered at the weekend near the home of a friend she was visiting. The woman had apparently been raped before being brutally killed:  Family member, Thabani Seme, says Bhengu was found naked with her stomach and throat slit. “As a family, we believe that it might happen that some men might have tried to make advances to their sister. Obviously, since she was lesbian she might have rejected them, which might have led to her being raped and killed. We believe they killed her because she knew her attackers,” says Seme. Bhengu’s friends say they are puzzled by the senseless killing. One of them is Sphesihle Mchunu. Mchunu says they are struggling to come to terms with the loss. “We are puzzled why Anele killed in a brutal manner, we have tried to ask the friend Anele was visiting is giving different stories about the incident,” adds Mchunu.
