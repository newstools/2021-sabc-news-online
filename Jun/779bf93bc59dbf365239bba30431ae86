Three men have been shot and killed in Samora Machel in Nyanga on the Cape Flats. Police spokesperson Andre Traut says they have implemented a 72-hour activation plan to probe the death of the men. The victims are between 20 and 25 years old. Traut says no arrests have been made as yet. “At around 06:30 the bodies of the three victims were discovered in the road in Vlei informal settlement in Samora Machel, each with one gunshot wound to the head. The motive for the murders is yet to be established and an appeal is made to any person who can shed light on the circumstances to kindly contact Crime Stop.” Meanwhile, police say they are continuing to probe last week’s killing of eight people in Gugulethu also on the Cape Flats. No arrests have been made as yet. Five people died on the scene, while three others later died in hospital. The victims were attending a traditional ceremony in the NY 79 area. It’s alleged the occupants of two vehicles opened fire on those gathered outside the house.
