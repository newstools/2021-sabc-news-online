The man accused of the murder of his four children at Ga-Phasha in Sekhukhune in Limpopo in 2020 has been sentenced to four life terms at the Polokwane High Court, or an effective 100 years in prison. Judge Gerrit Muller says he took into account that Lucas Phasha was on parole for murder and attempted murder when he killed his children. Phasha, who is a lawyer, killed the children, aged between three and nine, with a sharp object after a domestic dispute in 2020. Father suspected of murdering his 4 children set to appear in Limpopo court:  Social Development MEC Nkakareng Rakgoaele, who was amongst members of the public in the gallery, says Phasha deserves to stay in prison for the rest of his life. “Having listened to his previous convictions I am sure that you will agree with me that Mr. Phasha does not deserve to stay with society. Your attempted murder case of 12 years your murder case of 15.” Mother welcomes conviction The mother of four children has welcomed the conviction and the four life sentences handed down by the court. The mother, Sylvia Monyela, says it hurts that the father never admitted to killing the children. “I am so happy that they found him guilty, he will never see me again. It hurts that he never admitted that he killed them, but I am happy the court found it that indeed he killed them; so I am so happy.” NPA satisfied with conviction The NPA says it is satisfied with the four life terms handed down by the court. Provincial NPA spokesperson, Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, says the long sentence will serve as a deterrent. “As the NPA, we welcome the conviction and sentence as the prosecution managed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt in this case. We know that Phasha has killed his minor children, so this is a horrific crime. We welcome the sentence and we hope it will send the message to the public that justice has been served to this family.”
