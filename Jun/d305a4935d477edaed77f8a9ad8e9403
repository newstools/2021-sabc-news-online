The Limpopo Health Department says more than 16 000 thousand teachers and support staff were vaccinated with the Johnson and Johnson single dose in the province yesterday. The province plans to vaccinate over 30 000 employees by the end of the weekend at 37 sites. The vaccination process at the Seshego Hospital in Polokwane is continuing with people trickling in. Some teachers who received their vaccines at the hospital say they are relieved. “Everything is OK. People tried to intimidate us saying you will feel dizzy whatsoever, but nothing happened. I’m happy, we arrived at Seshego Hospital just before 7am, there were a few hiccups but eventually, the process kick-started and we were vaccinated, with no pain and later on, we were given a few minutes, 20 minutes or so as cooling off period. So I am released and I am relieved,” says some educators. Vaccination continues on Saturday:  Limpopo’s Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba has assured workers in the education sector of the efficacy of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. “Some people were saying we are giving teachers Johnson and Johnson, the efficacy, percentage, compared to  Pfizer. I got the very same Johnson and Johnson. The same health workers I’m talking about, received the Johnson and Johnson, they are here at work. So let’s be honest, spread this message that vaccination does help. Yes there’s no vaccination that will stop you from being infected, but all our vaccines will help you not to get sick, they will help you not to get hospitalised.”
