Northern Cape parents seeking 2022 school admission for their children have been asked to apply now and avoid the last-minute rush before the start of the academic year. The Education Department in the province says more than 11 000 grade 7 learners still need to apply for grade 8 in 2022. Parents who are not techno savvy are encouraged to use the 150 walk-in centres across the province where they will be assisted with the online applications. Northern Cape Department of Education spokesperson, Geoffrey van der Merwe says, “The 2022 online learner admissions process is well under way and learner registrations for grades R, 1 and 8 are progressing slow throughout the province, compared to last year.” “The department will embark on heightened efforts to advocate in terms of the online admissions system, as parents and legal guardians only have 16 days left to apply online for the 2022 school academic year,” explains Van der Merwe.
