Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay about $230 million to resolve claims it helped fuel an opioid crisis in New York, the stateâ€™s attorney general said on Saturday. The agreement addresses claims brought by Attorney General Letitia James, and will remove Johnson & Johnson as a defendant in a broader trial over opioids scheduled to begin next week. J&J did not admit liability or wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. It said the agreement was consistent with its prior agreement to pay $5 billion to settle opioid claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments nationwide.
