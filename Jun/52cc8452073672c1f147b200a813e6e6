She was never deterred by the brutality of the security forces of the racist regime. She never wilted, even when more stringent security regulations were enacted by the regime in the dark days of apartheid.” Gcina, 84, served on many structures during her time fighting the apartheid regime including the Port Elizabeth Black Civic Organisation (PEBCO). She was also the first Chairperson of the Port Elizabeth Women’s Organisation (PEWO). She joined the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in the 1950’s and served in parliament as an African National Congress Member of Parliament from 1994 until 2004 when she retired.
