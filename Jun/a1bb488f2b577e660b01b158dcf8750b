Director of the FW de Klerk Foundation, Dave Stewart, has denied media reports that former President De Klerk’s health is rapidly deteriorating. He says the reports are misleading and that De Klerk is in good health. De Klerk was diagnosed with lung cancer earlier this year. “This is not so. There has been no discernible deterioration in his health since he was diagnosed in March with mesothelioma – a cancer that affects the lining of the lungs. He is now considering the continuation of the course of immunotherapy that he has been following for the past two months,” says Stewart . Stewart says De Klerk attended a meeting of the FW de Klerk Foundation Board on Monday – and comes into his office three or four times a week. He says De Klerk and his wife Elita, hope to travel to Greece for a holiday as soon as COVID-19 regulations permit.
