The Gauteng government says there is no record of the birth of ten babies in any of its health facilities, saying this could be fake news. This follows reports claiming that Gosiame Sithole broke the Guinness World Record at a Pretoria hospital on Monday night when she gave birth to the decuplets. However, Gauteng government spokesperson Thabo Masebe, says they’ve conducted a thorough search of public and private healthcare facilities and no records were captured proving the veracity of the reports of ten babies being born to a mother. “We have checked with all hospitals in the province, both public and private; none of them have records of such a delivery. We have not spoken to the family because we had to check a report that appeared in the media, and we checked hospitals and there was no record of such delivery of babies. This is possibly not true and it looks more like fake news.” However, Ekurhuleni Mayor Mzwandile Masina earlier tweeted that they had found the family and that the babies are well. He said he would later share information with the national government. Dear @mirriamp we’ve found the family and we are informed babies are well. Will share the information with National Gov, I know we were a joke ystday when Gov was genuinely looking for family. Some of our local comrades have been assisting this family. So we are good OK — Mzwandile Masina (@mzwandileMasina) June 9, 2021  Nazooo from the horses mouth.
