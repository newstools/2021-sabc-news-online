Funerals are restricted to a maximum of 50 people. No night vigils or post-funeral gatherings are permitted. In his address to the nation, President Cyril Ramaphosa says government’s focus is on limiting social contact to flatten the curve and contain the further spread of the COVID-19 virus. “We are still standing, because we are a resilient people that has overcome the worst many times in our history. Now a third wave is gathering in strength and force. Once again, we find ourselves at a defining moment in our fight against this disease,” he says. With Gauteng being the epicentre of the virus and accounting for more than 60% of infections countrywide, the President says there will be no travelling in and out of the province for leisure. This will not apply to people who travel for work and business purposes. This exemption is also for those who need to return to their areas of residence. Under adjusted lockdown alert level 4, restaurants and other eateries may only serve food for takeaway or delivery. Outside of work, South Africans are urged to only meet with members of their households. The President says the closure of schools for the winter holidays will be brought forward to this Friday – 2 July 2021. President Cyril Ramaphosa Nation address on COVID-19 responses:
