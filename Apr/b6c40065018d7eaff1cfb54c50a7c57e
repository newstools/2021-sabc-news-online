The Office of the African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip in Parliament says it is shocked and saddened at the passing of ANC Member of Parliament, Jacqui Mofokeng. ANC Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina says Mofokeng’s death comes a day after her daughter, Thato, died. Hamba Kahle, Qhawekazi! You remained a true cadre of our movement to the end. We will forever cherish the role you played in the emancipation of our people and women in particular #RIPJaquieMofokeng pic.twitter.com/zR8ZwwUGu3 — Panyaza Lesufi (@Lesufi) April 22, 2021  Majodina described Mofokeng as a strong advocate for the emancipation of women and the protection of children. In a statement released, Majodina further described Mofokeng as a dedicated member who served with dignity, humility, and commitment to strengthening the security cluster for the safety and protection of the lives of South Africans. She says Mofokeng also worked hard to advance the fight for a just society and to change the justice system. Majodina has extended the ANC caucus’ sincerest condolences to the family and friends of  Jacqui Mofokeng and her daughter Thato. At the time of her passing, Mofokeng was the ANC Study Group’s Whip of Parliament’s Justice and Correctional Services Committee. The Correctional Services Department has also paid tribute to the struggle stalwart. We express grief over this sad development and the pain is exacerbated by the fact that death
also claimed the life of her beloved daughter. Her vast knowledge and insight into matters related to justice and corrections will be solely missed, and as such, a huge void will be felt when considering the tenacity with which she dealt with issues. Ms Mofokeng did not mince her words as she passionately pushed both departments, Correctional Services and Justice and Constitutional Development, not only to deliver on their mandate, but to achieve greater impact on deliverables,” says the Ministry in a statement.
