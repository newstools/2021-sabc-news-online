Residents of Rabaki Informal settlement in Warrenton in the Northern Cape are at loggerheads with their local municipality over the existence of pit latrines in the area. Residents allege that the Magareng Local Municipality promised to replace pit latrines with flushing toilets as far back as 2014 but to no avail. However, the municipality maintains that this is not the case. The residents of Rabaki Informal Settlement say they are fed up with what they call an inhumane way of life. Spokesperson for the Magareng Local Municipality Thapelo Jacobs says removing the current pit latrines is not an option. Jacobs says, “It is not a question of us removing the structure. it is a matter of connecting the water system to the toilets. If you go in that particular toilet, you will see that there is a basin already inside which enables it, when it is connected it becomes a flushing toilet.”
