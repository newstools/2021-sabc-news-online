Holomisa says the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) had scheduled a consultative meeting with political parties on Thursday morning to discuss a proposal that the elections be postponed due to challenges they would be likely to face in campaigning during the COVID-19 pandemic. SA’s local government elections to take place on 27 October 2021:  The Department of Health was also scheduled to brief the parties at that meeting. Holomisa says all lockdown restrictions should now be done away with. “For the IEC to advise the President that he should announce the elections [date] on the eve of that meeting, causes us to pause and ask ourselves why call this meeting if you have already advised the President of the date.” “On the side of the President, I think he should just remove [or] withdraw the lockdown regulations so that we can be allowed to do proper campaigns.
