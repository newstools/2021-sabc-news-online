South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) Spokesperson, Paseka Letsatsi, says they are working around the clock to make sure that the delay of COVID-19 grant payments is resolved before month-end. Recipients haven’t received their payments in March and April. Letsatsi says payments have been delayed because SASSA is currently busy with end of financial year tasks. He says beneficiaries will get a double payment at the end of this month. “The payment was supposed to end in January so as an organisation we however are compelled to make sure that the payment ends. In January our books were closed and our systems were shutdown and when the announcement was made we had to go and activate the processes and make sure we evaluate and check that each and every person who is there is eligible because this was just an intervention to make sure that people get the R350. However this is a special arrangement and we had to make sure that we get approval from Treasury,” Letsatsi. He has apologised on behalf of the agency for the inconvenienced caused.
