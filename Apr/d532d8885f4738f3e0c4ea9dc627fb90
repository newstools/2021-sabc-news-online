The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has announced that the formal inquest into the deaths of 144 psychiatric patients in Gauteng in 2015 will start in July at the Pretoria High Court. Many of the patients died, allegedly from starvation and neglect, after the Gauteng Health department cancelled its contract with Life Esidimeni, apparently to save money. Thousands of patients were transferred to unsuitable NGOs where many died. Life Esidimeni tragedy leaves many shocked, embarrassed:  The formal inquest follows damning findings by Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, who led an inquiry into the tragedy. He found government officials acted in breach of the law and the constitution. Regional NPA Spokesperson, Lumka Mahanjana, says Judge President Dunstan Mlambo has now appointed a judge to lead the inquest. “Indeed, the Life Esidemeni Formal Inquest hearing will start on 19 July 2021. This was determined in a meeting held earlier today by Judge Teffo,  the National Prosecuting Authority, and the different representatives for the families, NGOs and legal defence.”
