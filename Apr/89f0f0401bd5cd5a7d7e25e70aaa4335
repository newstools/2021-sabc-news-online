The number of people arrested for public violence in Winburg in the Free State has risen to 21 from nine last week. This follows violent protests in which angry residents blockaded the busy N1 near the Makeleketla Township. Residents went on the rampage after learning that the Freedom Day commemorations will be held in Botshabelo. They demanded to be addressed by President Cyril Ramaphosa regarding water shortages in the area. More police have been deployed to Theunissen after protesting residents blockaded the busy ZR Mahabane Road with burning tyres. Free State Police Spokesperson, Thandi Mbambo, says they will continue to monitor the situation. Winburg residents demand to meet President Cyril Ramaphosa:  Hertzogville, Virginia and Zastron were also rocked by protests recently, with one political analyst warning that more demonstrations are likely as the country gears up for local government elections.
