The Basic Education Department has gazetted a new set of rules that may see teachers found guilty of sexual misconduct banned indefinitely from working at any South African school. The new terms and conditions of employment were gazetted on last week Friday by Education Minister Angie Motshekga. Some of the conduct which will qualify teachers for indefinite bans include having sexual relations with a learner and being found guilty of crimes such as murder, rape and assault in a court of law. South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) national spokesperson, Nomusa Cembi says they welcome the regulations. Cembi says, “On the matter of teachers who have committed sexual offences against learners, we’re saying as SADTU, it’s part of what we have been saying because even in our code of conduct as a union we are totally against our members having sexual relations with learners or abusing learners sexually. Teaching is a caring profession so teachers shouldn’t be allowed to make children their sexual objects.”
