South Africans will celebrate Worker’s Day on Saturday. This marks the country’s second Workers’ Day under the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown. Lockdown regulations forced millions of people around the world to depend on a  reliable internet connection to effectively communicate with the rest of the world. Behind the internet connections that have kept loved ones connected, and employees able to perform their jobs, are technicians whose job is to maintain the infrastructure behind the network. In this special Workers’ Day podcast, SABC News producer, Lebo Tshangela, speaks to a Fibre Optic Technician, who works for a Johannesburg fibre installation company that services the country’s major mobile companies about his job and working under lockdown. The 32-year-old, who has been working for the company for five years talks about the impact of COVID-19 on his job and the environment he works in. He chose to remain anonymous. Below is the Podcast:    Workers’ Day has been officially recognised and observed in South Africa since the first democratic elections in 1994. The holiday serves both as a celebration of workers’ rights and as a reminder of the critical role that trade unions, the Communist Party and other labour organisations played in the fight against Apartheid. Over the past year, SABC News has documented the lives of workers in the frontline as the world battles with the COVID-19 pandemic. Frontline Workers have continued to serve amid the global pandemic that has claimed millions of lives to date.
