The disbanded Provincial Executive Committee of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State has until Friday to lodge an appeal in the Constitutional Court. The Supreme Court of Appeal earlier declared the elective conference of May 2018 irregular and unconstitutional. The SCA found that the elective conference was riddled with irregularities. The March  31 judgment is in favour of disgruntled members the ANC who were embroiled in a legal tussle to unseat the PEC. Last month, the Free State ANC said they will be heading to the Constitutional Court to challenge the Supreme Court of Appeal verdict declaring the Provincial Elective Conference unconstitutional and unlawful. In the video below, aggrieved ANC members say the recent judgment by the SCA paves the way for the party to heal divisions: Unity Political analyst Sethulego Matebesi says the ANC leadership wants a united party ahead of the Local Government Election. “I don’t think the ANC at Luthuli House would want to see a protracted process because at the end of the day. They want a united ANC, we are going to the Local Government Elections, we are going to elective conference of the ANC next year and that’s why I would think the president of the ANC and those who want a united ANC would like to see this matter resolved as matter of urgency.” Legal expert Machini Motloung says, “You would understand that in the event that the losing party, the unsuccessful party, the aggrieved party fails to prosecute the appeal within the prescribed period, also fails to make an application for condonation – the effect thereof will be that the judgment by the Supreme Court of Appeal will stand and the order that has been made by the Supreme Court of Appeal will still be in operation. Meaning that the provincial conference of ANC in the Free State which has been declared invalid and unlawful would stand, meaning that the elected provincial executive structure will have no standing.”
