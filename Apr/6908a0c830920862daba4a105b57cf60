A Soshanguve father in Tshwane is seeking justice after his teenage daughter was run over by a bus and killed. The 14-year-old was a passenger of the overloaded bus, contracted to the Gauteng Education Department, at the time of the incident. She is said to have fallen from it when tragedy struck. Rofhiwa Constance Lebese’s father claims there was no consequence management nor any investigations into the incident. He accuses the education department in his district of sweeping the matter under the carpet. “I never received any correspondence regarding the outcome of investigations into what happened the day my daughter died, that is if there were any investigations at all. The bus company and the district officials are in cahoots,” says Freddy Kwinda, Lebese’s father. In an accident report, the bus driver conceded that the bus was full, but claimed the late learner and two other boys jumped, when it was turning at this intersection. The provincial education department says officials will visit the family to address concerns raised. “It is quite unfortunate that the family is not satisfied with the process. However, we have already interacted with our officials to visit the family against to provide necessary and professional support,” says the Gauteng Education Departmental Spokesperson, Steve Mabona. Rofhiwa’s father says he won’t rest until he finds justice.
