The commission of inquiry probing allegations of state capture will hear former minister Malusi Gigaba’s application for leave to cross-examine his ex-wife Nomachule Gigaba, who now prefers to be referred by her maiden name Mngoma. She is also expected to give Gupta-related evidence. In February, Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, found that Gigaba breached Parliament’s Executive Ethics Code in the naturalisation of members of the Gupta family during his tenure as the Home Affairs Minister. A witness has told the commission that the former minister Gigaba visited the Gupta residence in Saxonworld more than three times while he was working for him. He says Gigaba instructed him not to record the visits in his logbook. The former minister was also accused of collecting and receiving cash from the Gupta residence. Gigaba has denied all charges levelled against him at the commission. Malusi Gigaba’s legal team cross-examines witnesses in the video below:  Former Minister of Department of Public Enterprises, Lynette Brown, will kick off proceedings when the inquiry resumes at 09h00. Brown will be giving Denel-related evidence. The commission will also hear State Security-related evidence from Former Minister of State Security, David Mahlobo.
