African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to be quizzed about his 2017 ANC Presidential Campaign at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg on Thursday. In his testimony on Wednesday, Ramaphosa acknowledged that the ANC had not done enough to deal with the phenomenon of state capture when it first reared its head in 2011. He also defended the cadre deployment policy of the governing party saying there was nothing wrong with it in principle. He alluded to the matter declaring that the guidelines for internal party funding are not suited for the present time and need revision. He will also be questioned about the Gupta brothers in light of revelations of gifts and monies some ANC members are alleged to have received from them.  Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosaâ€™s appearance at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture had tongues wagging on social media as South Africans shared their views on the proceedings in Braamfontein.
