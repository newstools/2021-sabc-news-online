The Gauteng government says it will re-open the Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital in a week’s time after a fire gutted parts of the hospital. The facility had to be closed and patients were relocated. Millions of rand in damage was caused by the flames. The cause of the fire a week ago is not yet known. Gauteng Government Spokesperson, Thabo Masebe, says the two affected blocks will remain closed, while engineers continue their investigations. Masebe says they will begin relocating patients next weekend. “The rest of the hospital which was not affected by the fire is being prepared for the resumption of services and the return of patients. All patients will be transferred during the weekend of 1 May 2021 and the hospital will resume services from 3 May 2021.” Last week, Gauteng Premier David Makhura described the hospital’s temporary closure as a major setback. Makhura announced the temporal closure of the hospital following a fire that broke out last week Friday. 09:15 Visuals of Firefighters at #CharlotteMaxeke pic.twitter.com/ekFN3OVh9y — Gauteng Health (@GautengHealth) April 17, 2021  07:15 Visuals from Charlotte Maxeka Hospital. pic.twitter.com/AG545dwQ82 — Gauteng Health (@GautengHealth) April 17, 2021
