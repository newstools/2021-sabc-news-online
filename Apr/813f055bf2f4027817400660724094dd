Former cabinet minister Malusi Gigaba’s estranged wife, Nomachule, has told the State Capture Commission that a couple of months before her husband became Public Enterprises Minister in October 2010, he mentioned to her that Ajay Gupta told him that he would get the position. Responding to State Commission Evidence Leader, Anton Myburgh, at the State Capture Commission, Noma, says the frequency of his visits to the Gupta family’s Saxonwold home subsequently increased and he referred to the brothers as his “unofficial” advisors. “He would differentiate them from the advisors that he had from the DPE which I knew his legal advisor and Thami Msomi as well did he tell you who these unofficial advisors. Yes he told me it was the Guptas, Ajay and his brothers, which I don’t know all by name I am only familiar with Ajay more than the other ones,” she said. Noma Gigaba testifies in the video below:  When asked whether her husband told her what the brothers advised him about, she said: “He said about work about things that they were supposed to do.” Noma Gigaba took the stand after Commission Chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, dismissed her husband’s application to prevent her from testifying. However, she made it clear that she would rather not testify at the Commission. Noma Gigaba received a summons to the inquiry after she declined to appear two weeks ago. Her lawyer Mpati Qofa read a letter by Gigaba where she raised her concerns about her treatment at the hands of the Commission evidence leaders, the contents of some of her submissions and her continued marital status. Qofa says according to her client, parts of her affidavit to the Commission are inaccurate. Her husband, Malusi, tried stopping her from testifying, asking the commission to declare her affidavit inadmissible. However, the inquiry dismissed the bid and is due to hear his application to cross-examine Noma at a later stage.
