City Power has attributed cable theft and stormy weather conditions to the increased number of power outages in Johannesburg. Spokesperson, Isaac Mangena, says issues such as vandalism, sub-stations not functioning at their optimum and the long response time with fixing outages is one of the challenges they are facing. Mangena says they are working with the police and community law enforcements groups to curb the rampant scourge of cable theft.  He also adds that the cityâ€™s power grid was not built to be switched on and off at frequent rates to accommodate load shedding. He says load shedding is strenuous on the system. Last week, City Power had major power outages that affected various parts of the city. The power supply to several substations was disrupted after a tree fell on one of the power lines. Affected areas stretch from Parktown and Auckland Park to Naturena and Eldorado Park, south of the city.
