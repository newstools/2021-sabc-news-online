Residents of Alexandra, north of Johannesburg, are up in arms again over the mushrooming of illegal structures in the already densely populated area. They’re particularly concerned about a new trend of four-storey buildings popping up in the informal sections of the township. In recent years there have been regular protests over illegal structures. It led to the formation of the Alex Total shutdown movement. Resident Sandile Mavundla says the City of Johannesburg must take action. “There’s that thing that is called a property boom, so there is a lot of mushrooming of those illegal structures which are wrong. City Power is overloaded because of the informal settlements because they are illegally connecting electricity. Stormwater blockages are common because people throw everything on the streets. People are building on floodlines.”
