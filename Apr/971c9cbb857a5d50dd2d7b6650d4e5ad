The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says it remains ready to start the corruption trial of former President Jacob Zuma on May 17. The remark comes after Zuma’s legal representatives, attorney Eric Mabuza and advocate Muzi Sikhakhane notified the Pietermaritzburg High Court that they will no longer represent Zuma, three weeks before the trial date of the former president’s corruption case. The NPA has released a statement, saying it acknowledges receipt of correspondence from Mabuza Attorneys. The law firm filed a notice of withdrawal with the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Wednesday morning. No reasons have been given. This after a three-year process to bring the case to trial. Zuma’s legal team quits, files notice of withdrawal with court:  Zuma and his family are yet to comment on the developments. The former President and French arms company, Thales, are facing charges in connection with South Africa’s multi-billion rand arms deal in 1999. The Supreme Court of Appeals recently ruled that the state is not liable for Zuma’s legal bill. – Report by Nonhlakanipho Magwaza
