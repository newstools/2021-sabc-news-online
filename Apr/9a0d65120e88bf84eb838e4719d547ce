Former President Jacob Zuma is expected to address a post-birthday celebration that has been organised by the South African National Civic Organisation’s (Sanco) Youth Congress in Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal, today. The former president celebrated his 79th birthday earlier this month. The event takes place a day after Zuma’s legal team announced their resignation, less than a month before his corruption trial was set to begin at the Pietermaritzburg High Court. About 200 young people attending the event are clad in African National Congress and Sanco regalia and are singing pro-Zuma songs. Zuma’s son, Duduzane, is also in attendance. Duduzane Zuma did not want to comment on the latest development in his father’s case. Mabuza Attorneys filed a notice of withdrawal with the Pietermaritzburg High Court yesterday. The withdrawal may lead to Zuma’s day in court being moved as he now has to find new attorneys:  Zuma is accused of having received bribes from a French arms firm, Thales International, through his financial adviser in order to protect the company from scrutiny. He faces corruption, racketeering, fraud, and money laundering charges related to the matter. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that the former president will have to pay back the money that the state has spent on his legal fees.
