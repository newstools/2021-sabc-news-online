Western Cape Transport MEC, Bonginkosi Madikizela, has been suspended from his position for two weeks pending an investigation. The Democratic Alliance’s Federal Legal Commission is investigating allegations that the provincial party leader’s CV claims a qualification that he does not hold. Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says he is deeply concerned that Madikizela’s biography contains information, which he has accepted is not true, as well as claims that he misled a journalist in this regard. Winde says once an investigation is complete he will make a final decision regarding Madikizela and his role in his cabinet. DA investigates Madikizela’s qualifications:  The Good Party and the ANC were those who called for Madikizela’s suspension in the wake of the damning claims. Good Party’s Secretary-General Bret Heron believes that the DA needs to explain why Madikizela was appointed to the cabinet three times, in 2009, 2014, and in 2019 without his political party vetting his qualifications. Madikizela’s CV on the Western Cape government website says he holds a Bachelors of Commerce Degree in Human Resource Management and a certificate in Information Technology.
