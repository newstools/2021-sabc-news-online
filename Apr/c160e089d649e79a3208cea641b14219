The KwaZulu-Natal government says it is accelerating its COVID-19 vaccination drive and that it’s on course to reach its target, having vaccinated more than 50 000 healthcare workers in both private and public hospitals. Premier Sihle Zikalala made the announcement in Durban on Sunday. Zikalala is confident that by the end of Phase 2 of the vaccination programme at the end of September, the province would have vaccinated about three million people. KwaZulu-Natal has over 90 vaccination sites and more than 7 000 people who are trained to administer the shots. The province has identified mass vaccination centres in Pietermaritzburg and Durban. Its target is to conduct 30 vaccinations per week. Zikalala gives an update on the COVID-19 pandemic:  “Vaccination for phase 1 (b) and phase 2 will run simultaneously. For instance, we will be vaccinating essential workers aged 40 years and above, at the same time as we vaccinate people in congregant settings and those with cormobilities who are aged 18 years and above,” says Premier Sihle Zikalala. He says they use an incremental approach during phase 2 and phase 3 of the programme, “with the number of vaccination sites getting increased as the programme is scaled up.” Government has also warned against complacency amongst locals and business establishments, particularly restaurants, who it claims are not adhering to COVID-19 safety protocols. The country has recorded more than one and half a million COVID-19 cases so far and the province has the second highest number of infections in the country.
