Parliament’s Presiding Officers, National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Amos Masondo are on Monday expected to appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg. Their appearance provides an opportunity for Parliament to articulate its oversight mandate and role. They are expected to also clarify questions that members of the public ask on how incidents of corruption and excesses could have happened under Parliament’s watch. There has been concern about an alleged lack of responsiveness to the recommendations of Parliament when adverse findings are made against some ministers and departments. Parliament’s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says in a statement that both Modise and Masondo are hopeful that their participation will contribute towards helping the commission to fulfill its mandate. The Commission will hear Parliamentary Oversight related evidence from the Speaker of the National Assembly, Ms Thandi Modise at 10h00 on Monday, 19 April 2021. #StateCaptureInquiry pic.twitter.com/SckcDFetLe — State Capture Commission (@StateCaptureCom) April 18, 2021  Break-in State Capture Commission spokesperson Mbuyiselo Stemela says Monday’s hearing will not be affected by this weekend’s break-in at the commission’s offices. Two laptops were stolen from different floors of the building and the police and cyber investigators are investigating the burglary. The Commission’s Secretary, Professor Itumeleng Mosala, says he is concerned that the commission is being targeted as the burglary was not the first incident.
