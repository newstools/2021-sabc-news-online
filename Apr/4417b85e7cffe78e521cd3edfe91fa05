The City of Cape Town’s Urban Management Department has launched its Service Improvement Project at Ravensmead, on the Cape Flats. The department says the project aims to improve the delivery of basic services. As part of the project, teams from the department will be deployed to various areas across the metro, where they will use an app to identify and log service delivery issues. Mayoral Committee Member for Urban Management, Grant Twigg, says around R10 million will be re-prioritised in the City’s current budget, in order to fund the project. “What we’re doing now is looking at the potholes, looking at water leaks, looking at what is happening in our rental stock, all of those issues. What is happening in the parks, the grass not being cut. All of those issues, we’re going to record now so that the different departments can start actioning those complaints.” Some residents at Ravensmead, on the Cape Flats, have called on the City of Cape Town to urgently speed up service delivery in their area. They say the city has failed to maintain the road surfaces in the area. Community members say the city is also not removing rubbish in their area as often as it should. One of the residents, Shirley Lakay, spoke to the SABC during a walkabout when officials from the City’s Urban Management Department visited the area to launch their new Service Improvement Project in the metro. “It’s not right what they are doing. This road has been so dirty for all these years. The children have to walk over the dirt. It really isn’t right. They should clean the road. A person expects the place to be clean when you wake up. You don’t expect to see rubbish.”
