Chicago officials have released a graphic body-camera video showing a police officer shooting and killing a 13-year-old boy while he appeared to be raising his hands. Adam Toledo was killed two weeks ago in an alley in a Mexican neighborhood in the city. The nine-minute video from Eric Stillman’s body camera showed the 34-year-old officer getting out of his squad car and running after Toledo yelling “Stop” to Toledo and ordering him to show his hands. The boy appeared to raise his hands right before Stillman fired one shot and then ran to the boy as he fell to the ground. The police officer is heard calling for an ambulance in the video. The Chicago Police Department said immediately following the incident that Toledo had a gun in his hand. The release of the video was likely to rattle a nation already on edge over issues of policing, justice and race relations. Tensions were high on Thursday as a former suburban police officer in Minnesota appeared in court after she was charged in the killing last Sunday of a Black man during a traffic stop. Hours earlier, the prosecution and defense rested their cases in the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged in the death of George Floyd, which ignited a wave of protests last year.
