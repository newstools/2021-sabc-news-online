Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen has described claims that Chief Whip in the National Assembly Natasha Mazzone has lied about her qualifications as fake news. Steenhuisen says while the party views lying about qualifications in a very serious light, the Good Party who has called on the DA to take action against Mazzone has its facts wrong. Steenhuisen was responding to the recent suspension of Western Cape leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela after it was found that he may have lied about having a BCom degree. The Good Party laid criminal charges against Madikizela. Steenhuisen commenting on the qualifications issue during campaigning in KZN:  Steenhuisen says the Madikizela and Mazzone situation are not the same. “The issue around Mazzone is completely different. It’s driven by fake news and by the Good Party who unfortunately didn’t get their facts right. It is very clear that Miss Mazzone is being the victim of a malicious smear campaign by the Good Party. I think it’s unfortunate as well that the Good Party chose to do so on the same day that her father passed away, thinking that she wouldn’t be able to respond. Thankfully for her, she responded vigorously and set out the facts very clearly.” Steenhuisen says his party views lying about qualifications in a very serious light.
