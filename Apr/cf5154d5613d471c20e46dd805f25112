Two officials from the Ncome Correctional Facility in KwaZulu-Natal have been dismissed following an investigation into a sex video involving a correctional services official and an inmate. South Africans were shocked when the footage went viral on social media last month. The official in the video and her colleague who allowed her office to be used for the sex romp were both dismissed. Correctional Services Department Spokesperson, Singabakho Nxumalo, says the inmate involved has been reclassified into maximum category. “The inmate involved was also not spared any mercy as he has been reclassified into Maximum category, he lost privileges and has been moved to another facility,” Nxumalo adds. The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) has reiterated that such acts and other forms of sexual attachment or illicit romance between officials and inmates can never be allowed nor tolerated. “The code of conduct is explicit and those found to have breached it will face the consequences. DCS will not hesitate to act against any form of transgressions. Ideal correctional officials must be exemplary not only to inmates, but to the broader general society,” the department concludes.
