South African researchers hope to restart the use of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine next week in an “implementation study” immunising healthcare workers, a top local scientist said on Wednesday. South Africa suspended the study last week after US federal health agencies recommended pausing the use of J&J’s vaccine because of rare cases of blood clots. “We do hope to start again next week,” South African Medical Research Council President Glenda Gray said during a webinar.
