SA Tourism says industry leaders are working on resolving issues around vaccine passports and restoring international travel. This as countries across the globe announce vaccine passports – which allow their citizens to use as proof of vaccination to travel overseas. The absence of international tourists coupled with lockdown restrictions – have resulted in financial difficulties for several businesses in the tourism and hospitality sectors.

It is going to be a bit of a struggle in terms of deciding the powers that be of each country and which vaccine they see fit for entry and others.
