Some 27-year-olds born at the advent of freedom in South Africa say regardless of the problems the country is facing they always have a reason to celebrate. Today marks 27 years since the first democratic elections in South Africa on April the 27th 1994. Freedom Day is important because it honours the anniversary of South Africa’s first non-racial election and pays homage to the country’s liberation from apartheid rule during which the minority exercised prejudice political power over the majority of the country. These South Africans are optimistic about the country’s future: “We are born in the new South Africa. So compared to the old South Africa, our parents never had the chance to vote. They never had a voice. ” “I was born in a coloured area, a coloured Indian area, but I moved into a former white area, so, inviting people home from university and high school to celebrate my religious day such as Eid was interesting where there were predominately white and black people and that’s an experience my parents did not have when they were young.” However, entrepreneur Emmanuel Kgaogelo says his small business is unlikely to succeed because as he puts it corrupt officials are taking away opportunities. “As a 27-year-old and young, black business owner, on a day to celebrate 27 years of freedom, I don’t have much to celebrate because of what is happening at this time in the country, simply because people that are in power are corrupt. I don’t celebrate freedom.” Infographic:A look at some of the limitations in the freedom enjoyed in SA
