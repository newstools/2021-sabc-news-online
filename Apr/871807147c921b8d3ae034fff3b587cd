Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize is expected to visit Nelson Mandela Bay in the Eastern Cape on Thursday to assess the state of healthcare. This comes in light of a hike in the number of COVID-19 cases nationwide and the province. The Minister will engage with the MEC of Health, Nomakhosazana Meth, and other senior officials and stakeholders of the provincial health department. The visit will also see the official handover of the refurbished maternity ward at Dora Nginza Hospital.
