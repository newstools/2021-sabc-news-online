The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) has urged all registered political parties to sign-up to the Online Party Funding System. This as the Political Party Funding Act comes into force on Thursday. The Act provides for the political parties in national and provincial parliaments to receive public funding and private donations, which must be disclosed. The system, which has been piloted by parties over the past two months, allows them and their donors to make electronic disclosures to the Electoral Commission via the internet. In a statement, the IEC has reminded all registered political parties that their first quarterly disclosure of direct donations in cash or kind above R100 000 is due at the end of the first quarter. To promote transparency donors who make direct donations above that threshold must also declare these to the IEC on the Online Party Funding System within 30 days. The Electoral Commission will make this publicly available quarterly on its website.
