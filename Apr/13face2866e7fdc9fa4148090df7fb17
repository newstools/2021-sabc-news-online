The Democratic Alliance (DA) has outlined their expectations ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s appearance at the Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State Capture on Wednesday, saying they want the African National Congress’ (ANC’s) Cadre Deployment Policy to be addressed. DA leader John Steenhuisen says he will be attending this morning’s sitting of the commission to watch President Ramaphosa’s testimony. Steenhuisen says the policy has allowed for state capture to continue for several years. “We would like to get to the bottom of the cadre deployment policy. It has hollowed out the state and opened the door for state capture to take place in South Africa. The best-case scenario would be to hear the President say they would abandon this policy and move towards merit-based appointments in the public service where your appointment is based on your ability to do the job and not on the colour of the party card in your back pocket.” He adds: “A large part of the problem that we sit with is massive failures such as Eskom, SAA, Denel – virtually every other SOE in the country is as a result of that policy.” Preview of Ramaphosa’s state capture inquiry appearance:  Meanwhile, the ANC has reiterated its support for the State Capture Commission ahead of President Ramaphosa’s appearance.
