The alliance partners of the ANC say they hope other members of the ANC will learn from Supra Mahumapelo’s suspension that no one is above the party. Mahumapelo and the acting provincial secretary of the ANC Women’s League Bitsa Lenkopane have been suspended for five years from the ANC. They were both charged with conduct, after allegedly convening a parallel meeting to that of the Interim Provincial Committee in Mareetsane near Mahikeng last year. Cosatu’s Provincial Secretary, Kopano Konopi, says, “We feel that it is high time the ANC becomes decisive on issues of discipline and demonstrates to all its members that discipline is something that must be obeyed in the ANC, and (that) all the resolutions and constitution of the ANC must be respected, including the respect of the leadership that is leading the ANC at the time, irrespective of whether it is the interim leadership or it is the leadership that is elected at the congress. We hope that members of the ANC will see that the ANC is serious in instilling discipline in the organisation.” Sanco’s Provincial Secretary, Packet Seaketso, the decision to suspend the two officials shows nobody is above the organisation. “We are aware that they have a right to appeal their decision to the highest decision–making body, which is the National Executive Committee Disciplinary Committee. But the fact of the matter is nobody can do as he pleases or as he wishes in the ANC, without the ANC taking a decision.” BREAKING NEWS | Supra Mahumapelo suspended from ANC for 5 years:
