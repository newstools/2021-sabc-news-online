Former CEO of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) Lucky Montana will finally appear before the commission of inquiry into state capture in Johannesburg on Friday morning.

He is also alleged to have inflated the value of the contract for front company Swifambo Rail from R3.5 to R5 billion. There are many other accusations levelled against the former CEO, which he is expected to explain to the commission. The Commission will continue to hear evidence relating to allegations of corruption at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) from the former Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO), Mr Lucky Montana at 10h00 on Friday, 16 April 2021. #StateCaptureInquiry pic.twitter.com/VFufYTqzfd — State Capture Commission (@StateCaptureCom) April 15, 2021  In a statement last year, he accused the commission of being biased and said the inquiry was a witch hunt against him. He has taken to Twitter to express his elation over the chance to tell his side of the story. Thank you family, friends & comrades. I’m in high spirits & look forward to testifying on Friday. I intend to assist, first & foremost, the Commission in its work, present credible evidence (not hearsay) and tell one of the fine stories of South Africa and the PRASA I know. — Tuku (@LuckyMontana19) April 13, 2021
