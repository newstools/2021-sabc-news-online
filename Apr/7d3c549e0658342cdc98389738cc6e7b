The African National Congress’ (ANC) North West Interim Provincial Committee (IPC ) has called on former premier and party provincial chairperson, Supra Mahumapelo, to refrain from contravening the party’s constitution. Mahumapelo is currently attending a disciplinary hearing alongside ANC Woman’s League Secretary, Bitsang Lenkopane, for allegedly holding a meeting in Mareetsane near where the IPC had organised an event. Yesterday, Mahumapelo told branch delegates in Delareyville that he believed the process was aimed at damaging his reputation. Spokesperson for the ANC IPC, Kenny Morolong, however says Mahumapelo has no regard for the party’s constitution. “These comrade undermines the decision and the directives of the IPC and the NEC. He has absolutely no regards for the ANC constitution, he has no regard for the ANC structures. His recent rents justify why the IPC decided to subject him to the disciplinary processes. Comrade Mahumapelo without him the ANC of his imagination cannot be led. We wish to issue a stand warning that we will not be held at ransom,” adds Morolong. During his address to his supporters yesterday, Mahumapelo accused the ANC of violating the Constitution, saying some of the party’s resolutions are in conflict with the law. He urged the ANC NEC to suspend its step-aside resolution until the party’s next national conference. Supra Mahumapelo briefs branches on recent suspension of a number of prominent ANC members:
