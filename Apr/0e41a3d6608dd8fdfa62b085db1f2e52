ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa says the late struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela will always be remembered for her efforts to ensure the improvement of the lives of South Africans. Ramaphosa delivered a keynote address at a wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of Madikizela-Mandela at the Fourways Memorial Park, north of Johannesburg, where members of the Mandela family and other ANC national leaders joined him. Ramaphosa says South Africans are blessed to have had leaders such as Madikizela-Mandela. “Thank you very much to all who are here. Indeed as we draw inspiration from her, we will walk the path of renewing the ANC, of uniting the ANC so that the party can be strong again to enable it to do what it was charged to do in 1912,  to ensure that our people have a better life. This what uMama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela had wanted throughout her life. So, thank you very much. Thank you comrades for being here, thank you.” Wreath-laying ceremony proceedings:  ANC National Executive Committee member Nomvula Mokonyane says it’s befitting for the party to continue to honour the legacy of uMama Madikizela-Mandela. “Today we commemorate her life in the year of Charlotte Maxeke, who said when you go up, take the others with you. Mama did exactly that, she multiplied, we see ourselves in her character in us doing the work we are doing to serve the people of South Africa and knowing they it will never be easy and it was never easy for Mama.”
