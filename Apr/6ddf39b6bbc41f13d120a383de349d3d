The country’s Judicial Conduct Committee has acknowledged receipt of papers from Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to appeal its decision over his comments on Israel. In the comments, Justice Mogoeng expressed support for Israel and said as a Christian, he cannot do anything other than love and pray for Israel “because I know hatred for Israel by me and for my nation will, can only attract unprecedented curses upon our nation.” The JCC found the Chief Justice guilty of misconduct and directed that he apologises for the remarks. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng ordered to apologise for pro-Israel comments:  The complaints were lodged by Africa4Palestine, the SABDS Coalition and the Women’s Cultural Group. The JCC says it will in due course determine the date on which the appeal will be heard by at least three of its members. Mogoeng is appealing on various grounds, amongst them that Gauteng Deputy Judge President Phineas Mojapelo was misdirected in the finding that the incident and complaints against him did not form part of freedom of expression and freedom of religion. The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) recently picketed outside the Constitutional Court in support of the Chief Justice. And the Africa4Palestine has expressed disappointment, in what it said ,was Chief Justice Mogoeng’s unwillingness to engage with the group on issues over his comments. Africa4Palestine Director, Muhammed Desai, believes by appealing the JCC’s decision Mogoeng chose an arrogant public posture.
