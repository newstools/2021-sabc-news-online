The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is set to meet with various political parties on Thursday to discuss the possible postponement of the 2021 local government elections. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has been lobbying other political parties to join its proposal to synchronise elections – saying parties should be able to campaign freely and interact with voters. The party says none of these activities, which are crucial in an election year, have taken place this year due to the coronavirus. The party’s sentiments have found resonance with the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and Al Jama-ah – whilst the Democratic Alliance (DA), Freedom Front Plus (FF+) and Action SA have rejected the proposal. EFF Deputy President, Floyd Shivambu says, “Of course we want to have a change of government and for elections to happen. But under the current conditions, we do not have space to speak to our people to give them an alternate vision to what is happening now. Without a democratic space being opened, we cannot force and go ahead with elections in the manner that it is.” The IEC has said its decision on the matter will be made after it has analysed the parties’ submissions and balanced them against the constitutional principles.
