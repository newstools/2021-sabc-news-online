Another African National Congress (ANC) mayor in the North West municipality has been removed through a motion of no confidence. The latest mayor to be removed is Tswaing municipal mayor at Delareyville, Dimakatso Malwane. She has been replaced by Olaotswe Makalela. So far six mayors have been removed in the province’s municipalities. Three of them in less than a week. The ANC Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) says the removal of the mayors was not mandated by the party. In the latest developments, where the mayor of Tswaing local municipality was removed yesterday (Wednesday), the entire mayoral executive, including the speaker, were also removed. Two days ago, the mayor of Greater Taung local municipality, Kgosi Nyokong Motlhabane, was also removed through a no-confidence motion. The ANC has since condemned the actions, saying it is perpetuated by its ill-disciplined deployees who collude with opposition parties. The IPC says it will formally pronounce itself regarding these developments over the coming weekend.
