ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa is testifying for a second day at the State Capture Inquiry. Yesterday while answering questions on the impact of cadre deployment on the functioning of the state, Ramaphosa said a balance needs to be struck between establishing a professional public service and delivering, what he says, is the ANC’s developmental mandate. He told the commission that appointments in the state should be made in an open manner so that state capture never again happens in South Africa. Today he is expected to answer questions about his 2017 ANC Presidential Campaign. He will also be questioned about the Gupta brothers amid claims that they showered some ANC members with gifts and money. Live stream of today’s proceeding is below:
