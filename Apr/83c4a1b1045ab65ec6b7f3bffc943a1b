Former State Security Minister David Mahlobo has denied any direct knowledge of a programme named PAN 1 within the intelligence agency. He is testifying before the State Capture Commission on issues related to the State Security Agency. The commission heard questions between Mahlobo and evidence leader, Advocate Paul Pretorius. “We are told by our investigators that PAN 1 was investigated internally within the State Security Agency and a report was made to Minister Bheki Cele approximately in November 2010, do you know of that,” says the Pretorius. “No, I only know when the time I became a Minister, when I received a report from the office of the Inspector-General but there is an indication that there was a request by the former minister to investigate the programme in terms of the law, where the Inspector-General must investigate any matter that is either referred to by his excellency, the president of the republic or by the minister,” says Mahlobo. The Commission resumes to hear State Security related evidence from Former Minister of State Security, Mr. David Mahlobo. https://t.co/uLgQYFpNG5 #StateCaptureInquiry — State Capture Commission (@StateCaptureCom) April 9, 2021  State Capture Inquiry | Commission hears State Security related evidence: David Mahlobo
