A Limpopo family is reeling from shock after their 14-year-old daughter died shortly after she reported a case of physical and sexual abuse, as well as intimidation against her mother’s boyfriend. The Ratombo family from Tshavhalovhedzo outside Louis Trichardt says Mulaedza Ratombo was sexually and physically assaulted at her home last Thursday when her mother and siblings were away. A suspect has been arrested:  A few hours before her death, Mulaedza said she had been sexually abused since October 2020. On Thursday, she was allegedly molested again and then threatened with death. After reporting it at a local police station, the girl who was diabetic fell sick and was rushed to Siloam Hospital. Mulaedza’s aunt Johanna Maanda says: “The doctor tried to normalise her diabetes and BP and checked the injuries but it was too late and she couldn’t make it.” The family says the health facility told them her death had been caused by stress, inner-ulcerations, and complications with diabetes. And that there was evidence of physical and sexual abuse. “I am completely devastated. I am the matriarch of this family since we have no parents. I don’t even know what to say but I must be strong for the sake of my sister and her children. I am feeling a lot of pain,” adds the aunt. A local youth NGO is helping the family with funeral arrangements. Joshua Simango says: “Yes as an organisation so far we are arranging with businesspeople and funeral parlour. They are already assisting with arrangements.” The suspect was arrested at his home village of Malula. He will appear in court on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Mulaedza will be laid to rest on Monday morning. -Reporting by Lutendo Bobodi
