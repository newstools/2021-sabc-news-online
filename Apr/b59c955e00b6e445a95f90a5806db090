AfriForum says it has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa demanding that Police Minister Bheki Cele vacate his position. AfriForum says the recent revelation of the South African Police Service internal systems being shut down due to non-payment to the service provider is an example of Cele’s negligence. The system is used to store evidence and a list of firearms issued to police members. AfriForum’s Legal and Risk Manager for Community Safety, Marnus Kamfer, says Cele’s bullying attitude is emulated by many of his subordinates, with the result that the SAPS regularly becomes violent with members of the public. This week, Minister Cele released a public order policing report, looking into policing and crowd control in South Africa. The report called for the demilitarisation of the police service, among other things. It was commissioned following the recommendations of the Farlam Commission that looked into the 2012 Marikana tragedy, in which 34 miners died when police opened fire on striking Lonmin mineworkers at Wonderkop outside Rustenburg in the North West. Recently, 35-year-old Mthokozisi Ntumba was shot dead when police fired rubber bullets on protesting Wits University students. The video below is on the public order policing report:
