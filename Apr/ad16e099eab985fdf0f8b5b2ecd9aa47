The Traditional Prime Minister to the AmaZulu nation, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, has revealed that there were allegations that the Regent, Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu, had been poisoned when she fell ill two years ago. Buthelezi spoke to SABC News in an exclusive interview before the Queen passed away from an unknown illness at Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg on Thursday night. The 65-year-old Queen was appointed regent last month in accordance to the wishes of the late King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu. Buthelezi says the Queen spent most of her time in Eswatini after falling ill. “When she left she was ill and rumours were that she was poisoned. Other things are too…I’m not going to get into them. Any condition of anyone is she was not a public figure I would say it quite wrong to ask me because any illness of any person is actually the prerogative of that person. But I have told you that she has been ill all the time because there were rumours when she went to Milpark Hospital and later to Swatini that she was poisoned, and then I’m not prepared to elaborate on that because that is the position,” says Prince Buthelezi. Buthelezi has called on the public and the media to give the Zulu Royal Family space and privacy to deal with the Regent’s passing. He made the call in the interview below:  The Zulu monarch’s Prime Minister has said the Queen’s funeral details will be released in due course. He has also assured the nation of AmaZulu that they won’t allow a leadership vacuum to exist following the Queen’s passing. Condolences meanwhile continue to pour in over Queen Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu’s death. Maiden Minders, who teach young women and girls on aspects of preserving their culture and purity, say it has been difficult to lose the nation’s pillars in such a short space of time. “It is extremely difficult losing our pillars as Zulu nation we are in pain, our maidens are crying after hearing the news of the departure of our Queen. I am a leader of Maiden Minders in eThekwini region we are in charge of thousand maidens, at this stage we can only call for prayers we are in need of all the prayers we are all saddened by the passing of our Queen,” says leader of the minders in eThekwini, Busisiwe Ntombela. Ntombela also remembers the Regent for her leading role in hosting the annual, women only “Umkhosi Wesivivane” ceremonies to celebrate the role of women in nation of AmaZulu. “Besides the Reed Dance, Queen MaDlamini used to host uMkhosi Wesivivane in August for women she was dearly loved by women. We are unable to express our shock and sadness. At the end of this ceremony she used to remind us that she will see us at Nyokeni Palace. She was our Mother and also the Mother to the maidens as well, she use to advise maidens about preserving culture,” adds Ntombela.
