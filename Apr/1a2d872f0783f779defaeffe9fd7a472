Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has given permission to the State Capture Commission’s legal team to issue a summons for Nomachule Gigaba to appear at the inquiry. This follows her abrupt withdrawal from testifying on Tuesday evening. The commission was informed by Gigaba’s attorney this afternoon of her decision to no longer participating in the inquiry. Gigaba was due to testify virtually on Friday from Cape Town via Zoo. While details over her reasons for withdrawal are sketchy, she has expressed unhappiness with the manner in which she has been treated by the commission. Nomachule Gigaba’s letter to the commission is read in the video below:  Gigaba’s estranged wife had availed herself to testify at the inquiry after publicly saying the evidence of the former minister’s bodyguard was accurate. According to the bodyguard, Gigaba used the cash that the Guptas had given him to buy suits and settle restaurant bills. Gigaba has reportedly applied to the commission to declare his wife’s evidence inadmissible.
