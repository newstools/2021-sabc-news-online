Chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC) in Ekurhuleni Mzwandile Masina has called on the ANC National Executive Committee to rethink the step aside resolution. The resolution stipulates that all members who are accused of serious crimes including corruption should step aside until their court cases are finalised. ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule is facing corruption, fraud and money laundering charges linked to a multi-million-rand contract to remove asbestos roofing from houses when he Free State premier. Magashule is one of ANC leaders who have until the end of this month to step aside until their corruption cases are finalised. Failure to do so voluntarily will result in their suspension from the ruling party. In his address to the media on the sidelines of the ANC Cadres Regional Assembly in Alberton on Sunday, Masina said Magashule should be given a chance to state his case. “Comrade Ace has not been found guilty. I believe he must be given an opportunity to be heard and for his case to listened to…I don’t believe that we must fire leaders on Zoom. The leadership must sit down and they must engage because the outcome of Nasrec can never be ignored,“ said Masina. Meanwhile, the ANC in Ekurhuleni says it fears that the step-aside policy will plunge the organisation into chaos. There’s also a concern the resolution will create problems for councillor selection in branch meetings, as outlined in the video below:  Fezile Dabi to interdict ANC NEC Magashule’s home region the Fezile Dabi District Municipality says it will interdict the ANC if Magashule steps aside. Branches in the region have gone a step further by accusing the NEC of being selective in the implementation of the step-aside resolution. Regional Convener Jabu Sigasa says branches want an urgent National General Council to deliberate on Magashule’s future. Reporter Samkele Maseko provides more details:
