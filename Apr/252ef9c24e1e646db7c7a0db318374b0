Former President Jacob Zuma says the African National Congress (ANC) has dumped and left him high and dry. This emerged from a document from a virtual meeting the former president held with the party’s Top Six two weeks ago. The meeting was initially meant to be held at the governing party’s headquarters, Luthuli House, in Johannesburg. However, was moved online after the former head of state pulled a no-show. In an extensive presentation to the party’s top brass, Zuma said the ANC leadership was not genuine in its meeting with him over his refusal to go to the State Capture Commission of Inquiry. Zuma accused the ANC leadership of creating a show to his detractors that the leadership can rein him and showed a false pretense of sympathy. The legally and politically embattled former president has repeatedly also refused to hold meetings with his successor President Cyril Ramaphosa. Apparently he is upset over Ramaphosa’s failure when he was still the party’s deputy president and that of the country, to tell then President Zuma that the ANC NEC had refused to give him a three-month grace period before he resigns as the Head of State. Zuma says he could not meet with Ramaphosa because he didn’t know if the current ANC President was supporting him or not and thus couldn’t discuss sensitive matters with him. The former president went further to say the ANC Leadership has failed to protect him as he faced an onslaught on allegations that he was corrupt and enabled state capture at the hands of the notorious Gupta family. Former president Zuma tells ANC Top Six that he feels hard done by the party:  The issue of Zuma’s refusal to appear before the Zondo commission to answer to corruption allegations is now before the Constitutional Court. Various quarters have called on the Apex Court to hold him accountable for his actions.
