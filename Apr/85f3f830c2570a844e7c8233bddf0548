The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to institute an urgent investigation into allegations that Defence and Military Veterans Minister, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, wasted millions of taxpayers’ money on chartered flights and luxury accommodation. The party says she must also be suspended without compensation pending the outcome of the investigation.
