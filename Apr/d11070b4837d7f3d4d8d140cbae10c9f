French energy group Total on Monday declared force majeure on its $20 billion Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project in Mozambique and withdrew all personnel from the site after insurgent attacks last month. Declaring force majeure implies a weightier suspension and allows Total to cancel contractors. Dozens of civilians were killed in March in the coastal Mozambique town of Palma, near gas projects worth $60 billion that are aimed to transform Mozambique’s economy. The attacks have dealt a blow to plans by Total and rival Exxon Mobil, which also has an LNG project in Mozambique, to turn the African nation into a major LNG producer to Australia, Qatar, Russia and the United States.
