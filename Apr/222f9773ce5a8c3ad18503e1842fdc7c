The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) has commended the private prosecution against National Assembly  Speaker Thandi Modise. Modise is on trial for alleged animal cruelty that took place on her farm while she was still the Premier of the North West. She is charged with six counts of animal cruelty relating to animals that died on her farm in 2014. The party says this is both good stewardship and a demonstration that no one is above the law. ACDP senior member of parliament Steve Swarts says the case reflects the highest form of accountability. “We as ACDP we believe that this is a measure of society to the most vulnerable including its animals,” says Swarts. “We also believe that none is above the law including the speaker of the national assembly-the honourable Thandi Modise,” adds Swarts.
