Four suspects aged between 25 and 53 are set to apply for bail in the Piet Retief Magistrateâ€™s Court in Mpumalanga on Monday in connection with the killing of two men on a farm earlier this month. Daniel Malan, Cornelius Greyling, Othard Klingberg and Michael Sternberg are accused of shooting and killing two brothers Zenzele and Amos Coka on the farm in Pampoenkraal. The case has caused a public outcry in the area. The two brothers were part of a group of farm dwellers who went to seek employment as they were seasonal farmworkers. Four farmers accused of the murder of 2 brothers in Mkhondo, apply for bail:  It is reported that on their way back they realised that one of them was left on the farm. Upon return on the farm, they found that he was being assaulted. A scuffle ensued and the two were shot and killed on the scene. During the previous court appearance community members, political parties and organizations representing, farm dwellers and workers demonstrated outside the court. They are all opposed to the suspects getting bail. In the video below, SABC News reporter Tumelo Machogo speaks to protestors outside court at the accused last appearance:
