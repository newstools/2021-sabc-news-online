African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) member Zizi Kodwa has called on all party members to rise above their personal interests and respect the ANC. Kodwa’s call comes after ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule requested the province to submit lists of members who are charged with serious crimes. Magashule himself has been charged with fraud, corruption and money laundering related to a multi-billion-rand tender to remove asbestos roofing in the Free State when he was premier of that province. Magashule wants the lists of ANC members charged with corruption:  Although the NEC has instructed those who are charged with serious crimes to step aside until their court cases are finalised, Magashule has said he first wants to consult former senior party leaders on the matter. Speaking in Brighton in the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro in the Eastern Cape, where he is on an election campaign trail, Kodwa said no one should defy the ANC. “Even if they might have reservations about the guidelines of step-aside. Step-aside is not a decision of the National Executive Committee. The National Executive Committee is executing the decision of the conference. It’s branches of the ANC that took the decision. It does not target anybody. By the way, almost all people who are implicated in terms of that resolution, when that resolution was taken at Nasrec, none of them were elected. They were not in the positions that they are in because it was taken before elections and no it cannot be alleged that the decision was taken to target certain individuals, it’s not,” says Kodwa. Ace Magashule says he accepts, respects ANC’s NEC ‘step aside’ decision:
