A family of a 64-year old woman who was raped in Pampierstad in the Northern Cape is pleading with the police to speed up investigations of the case. The rape is alleged to have happened in January 2021. The family say the suspect, who lives in the same area, continues to threaten them for opening a case against him. It is alleged the suspect broke into the house of the 64-year old during the night and allegedly raped her.  The family says they have identified the suspect who is in his thirties to the police, however, he continues to roam the streets. They say the incident has changed their lives and has left their mother traumatised. “I wish police would speed up investigations so that my mother can get closure. We live in fear.” said a family member. “What happened is very painful. I don’t like seeing her in this state,” add a family member. Northern Cape police Spokesperson Dimakatso Mooi says they are waiting for forensic test results before they can make any arrests. “A case of rape is still under investigation. A sample was taken from the alleged suspect for testing and we are still awaiting forensic results,” says Mooi. The family maintains that the past four months have been the hardest as they continue to go for counselling. They have since relocated the elderly woman for her safety.
