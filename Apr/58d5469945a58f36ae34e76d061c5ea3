Diamond City residents in Kimberley have been left frustrated due to water disruption caused by the critically low water level of the Newton reservoir. There has been no official statement by the Sol Plaatje Municipality but councillor Ockie Fourie says a waterworks team has been sent out to investigate and determine the cause of a lack of water supply to Newton reservoir. Fourie further says pumps at Riverton are pumping at full capacity. Residents are waiting with bated breath for water to be restored, says Fourie. Premier intervened in 2019 In 2019, Northern Cape Premier Dr Zamani Saul intervened in the unstable water supply that is negatively affecting Kimberley residents. A task team had been formed to assess immediate measures and long-term solutions to address the water challenges. The Sol Plaatje Municipality imposed water restrictions. Water was switched off at night to secure an adequate continuous water supply during the day. Premier Saul said at the time that the bulk infrastructure is unable to keep up with the current major development in the City. “We put up a team of engineers to look at the actual problems of bulk water supply and the ageing infrastructure so that we can come up with a comprehensive plan to address this problem, once and for all.”
