The family of a 16-year-old girl, who was allegedly raped by a 76-year-old man, says they are devastated after the man was granted bail. The elderly man was released on R500 in the Warrenton Magistrate’s Court earlier this week. The man allegedly raped the teenager at least twice after gaining access to her at the family home where he was training her mother to become a sangoma. The parents of the child have questioned the amount of bail set for the suspect. “The amount should have been more than R500. We are saying we a we are sad. It cuts deep like a knife within your heart, especially if you’re the one directly affected by the situation. But let the law take its course,” they say. The teenager’s father says the bail verdict deepened the family’s pain. “I would have liked the court to keep him in jail so that if it didn’t sink in him what he’s done, he’ll get time to think of it while he’s inside. Now, he believes that for him it’s like a win, just by being free. He’s going home to his kids whilst he’s traumatised the other family,” adds the father. The family says it is undergoing therapy. The National Unitary Professional Association for African Traditional Health Practitioners has is concerned over the allegations against the sangoma. The organisation says allegations of rape against any traditional healer taints the work of traditional healers. The association’s Northern Cape Secretary Benny Collins says, “If the court can call us, we can be against him. We can stand for the family and tell the court that this old man must go to jail. And this will be a lesson to the next person who will also try to do these things.”
