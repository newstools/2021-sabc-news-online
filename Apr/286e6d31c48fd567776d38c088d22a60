More than 100 students from Walter Sisulu University (WSU) in Mthatha in the Eastern Cape spent the night in the OR Tambo Hall in Southernwood. Students from both the Nelson Mandela Drive and Zamukulungisa Heights campuses in Mthatha have expressed their frustration as they had to sleep on chairs in the hall. They were evicted from campus on Tuesday after two days of violent protests in which they were demanding NSFAS money, registration, a graduation ceremony and accommodation. They say they are awaiting a response from the universityâ€™s management regarding their demands. University management closed all its campuses after the violent protests.  The students also want to return to the residences to get their remaining belongings. Three students were arrested but two were later released while one remains in custody. A police Nyala vehicle was set alight, allegedly by the protesting students on Monday. Four police officers were injured during a standoff with the students.
