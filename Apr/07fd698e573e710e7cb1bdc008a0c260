Former Transnet Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) Siyabonga Gama says contrary to former Board chairperson Popo Molefe’s allegation, he is not an architect of state capture. Gama has further disputed allegations that then Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba influenced his appointment. Gama has told the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, that there have been inconsistencies in the statements of some of the witnesses who have appeared before the commission, including Molefe. “According to Molefe my appointment was due to the influence of Gigaba. This allegation I believe has been purposed to fit the State Capture narrative. I have worked through the ranks and was appointed as CEO through hard work and dedication and not through the influential hand of [former Minister] Gigaba as [former Board chairperson] Popo Molefe would have you believe. Mr Gigaba was appointed as Public Enterprise Minister in 2010, at that time I had already worked for Transnet for more than 16 years,” says Gama. Live stream below:
