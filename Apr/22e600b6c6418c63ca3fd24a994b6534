Western Cape Minister of Community Safety, Albert Fritz, has been appointed as Democratic Alliance (DA) acting leader for the next two weeks. This follows the 14-day suspension of provincial party leader, Bonginkosi Madikizela on allegations that he had falsified his academic qualifications. Madikizela claims on the provincial government website to hold a Bachelor of Commerce Degree in Human Resource Management. Premier Alan Winde announced his suspension while investigating allegations is under way. Fritz also holds the position of Deputy DA leader in the province. ANC welcomes suspension The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape legislature has welcomed the suspension of Madikizela but says they are not happy with the 14-day suspension imposed. Leader of ANC in the provincial legislature, Cameron Dugmore says the matter should have been decided by the Code of Conduct Committee. “We disagree with Winde’s self-imposed period of 14 days. We have called for the code of conduct committee of the legislature to conduct an enquiry into the conduct of MEC Madikizela. This committee is a multi-party committee of the legislature. And it is this investigation that commences and only once it is concluded and its findings have been reported to the legislature, should there be any consideration on whether to lift the suspension or not. So thus, we reject the 14-day period.”
