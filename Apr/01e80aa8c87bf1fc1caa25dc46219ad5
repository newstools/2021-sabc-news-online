The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) has recommended that the government lifts the pause on administering Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine, when certain conditions are met. It says they include strengthened screening and monitoring of participants who are at high risk of a blood clotting disorder. SAHPRA says measures are to be implemented to ensure the safe management of any participants who develop vaccine-induced thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. SAHPRA says it recently reviewed data from Johnson & Johnson’s local research study immunising healthcare workers and found no major safety concerns.
