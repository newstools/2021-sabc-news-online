The Russian developer of the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine said on Thursday it would sue the Brazilian health regulator Anvisa for defamation, prompting a stern rebuttal from the agency. Anvisa’s board on Monday denied requests by Brazilian states to approve Sputnik V for import. The agency’s manager for medicines and biological products, Gustavo Mendes, said there was evidence an adenovirus used in the vaccine could reproduce, which he called a “serious” defect.  Denis Logunov, who developed Sputnik V at Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, denied on Tuesday that the two adenoviruses used to produce the vaccine could replicate. Sputnik V’s official Twitter account on Thursday quoted Mendes, who cited Gamaleya Institute’s test results at a public hearing on Monday as the basis to deny an import license.  In a press conference on Thursday, Anvisa officials rejected the “grave accusation” and insisted the Gamaleya Institute’s own paperwork flagged potentially risky levels of RCA in the finished vaccine. “The data presented by the Gamaleya Institute show the presence and acceptance of the replicating virus in the finished product,” said Anvisa’s Mendes in a Thursday briefing. “That specification is 300 times higher than the highest regulatory threshold we could find.”
