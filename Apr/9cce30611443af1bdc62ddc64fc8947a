The body of Lindani Myeni is reportedly due to arrive in South Africa on Friday. The 29-year-old former KwaZulu-Natal rugby player was shot dead by police in Hawaii this month – after he was apparently mistaken for a robber. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala made the announcement earlier when he was giving an update on the provincial government’s plans to repatriate Myeni’s body.  Myeni’s wife, Lindsay, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the police. There are allegations that the Hawaii police in the US failed to identify themselves as officers when they approached Myeni in the dark and shone torch lights into his eyes. However, the Hawaii police say Myeni severely assaulted two officers and they had to use lethal force to defend themselves. Police say that Myeni who lived nearby allegedly followed a woman into her home and took off his shoes. Police also say that when they arrived at the home, he charged at their officers. Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard says Myeni exhibited strange behaviour. “Officers administered first aid to the suspect and the man was transported to the hospital in critical condition. He died of his injuries at the hospital. The three responding officers were also taken to the hospital for multiple injuries,” says Ballard. “The first officer to arrive has multiple facial fractures, a concussion and injuries to his arms and legs. He remains hospitalised. He has 23 years of service. The second officer suffered multiple injuries to his body, arms and legs. The third officer had a concussion and multiple abrasions to the body, arm and legs. Both officers received medical treatment but have since been released,” she adds. Myeni is survived by his wife and two children. His wife Lindsay has dismissed allegations that he was a burglar. Lindsay Myeni in conversation with SABC News:
