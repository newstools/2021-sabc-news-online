Power utility, Eskom, says it will implement Stage 2 load shedding from 9pm on Tuesday to 5am on Wednesday due to a shortage of generation capacity. It says available generation capacity was reduced by the tripping of three generation units. Eskom says the load shedding is also necessary in order to manage and preserve the emergency generation reserves. “A generation unit each at the Tutuka and Kendal Power Stations tripped while a single Komati unit was forced down. The return to service of a generation unit each at the Kriel, Medupi and the Duvha power stations has been delayed. Eskom is working hard to return these units to service as soon as possible. We will keep the public informed as soon as there is a significant change in the power system status,” Eskom says in a statement. The power utility has encouraged South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly. #POWERALERT1 Eskom to implement Stage 2 loadshedding from 21:00 tonight until 05:00 tomorrow due to
