Two suspects aged 18 and 25 are expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday in connection with the murder of a police officer who was stabbed to death at Cornubia near Verulam, north of Durban. It is alleged that Sergeant Nduduzo Sibiya 36 was stabbed and killed after helping a woman who was being assaulted. His attackers then fled with his service pistol. Sibiya was stationed in the Durban harbour and was off-duty at the time. KwaZulu-Natal Hawks spokesperson Simphiwe Mhlongo says the two suspects were arrested in Bergville. Mhlongo says, “They were arrested for murder and robbery of the police officer who was fatally stabbed on Sunday morning at Verulam area. Sergeant Sibiya was helping a woman who was being assaulted by one of the males. He went to the tuckshop and he was followed by the suspect who found him there and stabbed him.” “He was taken to hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. The suspects made off with the sergeant’s firearm after he was stabbed and fled the area. We believe that they were hiding in Bergville,” added Mhlongo. #sapsHQ #Hawks members from Durban Serious Organised Crime Unit have arrested two suspects aged 18 and 25 for murder of a police official at Cornubia area in Verulam on Sunday. #PoliceKillings MLhttps://t.co/TlWZOQf5tG pic.twitter.com/oz7SBFlsbs — SA Police Service  (@SAPoliceService) April 13, 2021
