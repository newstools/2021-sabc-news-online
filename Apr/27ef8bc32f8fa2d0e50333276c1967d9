The alleged mastermind behind the murder of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule has maintained his innocence. Ntutuko Shoba is appearing in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court west of Johannesburg to apply for bail. He says he will not tamper with evidence or witnesses should he be granted bail. In June last year, Pule’s body was found in an open veld in Roodepoort. She was eight months pregnant at the time. This is Shoba’s second attempt at bail. Reporter Hasina Gori has more details:  Shoba axed from JSE On Friday, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange axed Shoba, confirming in a written statement that he is no longer an employee. Shoba worked in the IT division. The company has since said it is working with authorities and will continue to cooperate. Shoba had been on cautionary suspension since his arrest in February after Muzikayise Malephane confessed to Pule’s murder and turned state witness.
