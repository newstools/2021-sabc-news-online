The man accused of killing Gauteng African National Congress (ANC) Provincial Legislature Member Mapiti Matsena, in July last year, has pleaded guilty. Monoko Francis Thoka told the Pretoria High Court that he worked for Matsena but that he felt Matsena did not treat him with respect. In his guilty plea, he states that he left Matsena’s employment in January last year, but after several requests, Matsena refused to give him back some of his possessions. Thoka says he felt disrespected and decided to stab Matsena to teach him a lesson. Matsena’s brother, Abel, says they are glad Thoka admitted guilt. “We are so happy about what is happening but now the postponement of the case opens other doubts. He accepts all the charges and he pleads guilty for all charges. He deserves to go for life but now he acts like a sober person. We don’t know whether there is a person, a mastermind behind this but he accepts everything.” Matsena was stabbed about 15 times in the chest at his home in Doornpoort in Pretoria in July. At the time, he was head of the Gauteng Community Safety Portfolio Committee. Below is Matsena’s funeral service:
