Former North West premier Supra Mahumapelo is expected to appear before the party’s Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) in Mahikeng later on Thursday. He is accused of sowing divisions in the ANC. He was charged alongside ANC Women’s League provincial secretary Bitsa Lenkopane. On Wednesday, the IPC announced its decision to temporarily suspend Mahumapelo’s ANC membership. Political analyst Andre Duvenhage says the decision to suspend Mahumapelo is politically motivated. The suspension comes after he instructed JB Marks Local Municipal mayor Kgotso Khumalo not to resign. The IPC had earlier requested Khumalo to resign as he’s facing fraud and corruption charges. According to the charge sheet, Mahumapelo, who is also Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Tourism chair, is facing five charges which emanate from a rally that took place in Mareetsane village in the Ratlou municipality. The IPC accuses Mahumapelo and Lenkopane of organising and addressing a rally that took place only some metres away from an official Siyanqoba Rally organised by the IPC in the same area. Meanwhile, ANC members loyal to Mahumapelo are expected to picket outside the party’s provincial offices in Mahikeng where the hearing will take place, in support of him.
