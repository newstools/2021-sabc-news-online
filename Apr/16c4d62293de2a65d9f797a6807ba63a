Activists with the #PayTheGrants campaign will march to Parliament and the Union Buildings on Thursday to demand that the COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress Grant be increased and extended. During his State-of-the-Nation-Address in February, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced the three-month extension of the grant of R350 which was due to end on January the 31st. Now with the deadline looming once again, civil society groups want to ensure that the grant is extended again.
