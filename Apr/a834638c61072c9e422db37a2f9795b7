The 15-year-old Mbilwi Secondary School learner, in Limpopo, who committed suicide after being assaulted by a fellow learner outside the school premises on Monday is being laid to rest this morning. Lufuno Mavhunga overdosed on pills shortly after the assault and later died at the Siloma Hospital. A video of the assault has been trending on social media. In an emotionally charged memorial service yesterday, friends and family remembered her as a kind and peaceful person. Even in the mist of the bullying she managed to smile because she is a peaceful sweetheart #lufunomavhunga #Lufuno pic.twitter.com/0qEcEEzDil — Noko M (@Ningi_Nice) April 16, 2021  A call was also made for the Department of Basic Education to take Life Orientation seriously.
