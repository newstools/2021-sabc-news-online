The eThekwini Municipality has partnered with a soft drink company to provide borehole water to the rural villages of eKhuseni and eNgonweni near iNanda, north of Durban. Previously villagers in the two areas were dependent on water supplied by tankers which were not always available and others had to share river water with livestock. Speaking at the project launch, eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda said the installed boreholes would provide about 100 000 litres of water a day. Kaunda says, “The company built a purification and pump station that will circulate water and avail it to nearby schools as well as to the community. This shows a company heeding a call by the government for businesses to partner with the private sector in developing communities. We as the municipality will continue building boreholes where we don’t yet have adequate infrastructure.”
