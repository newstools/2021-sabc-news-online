The Young Communist League of South Africa (YCLSA) has pledged its support for newly elected African National Congress (ANC) National Youth Task Team. However, it cautions against factionalism filtering down from the mother body. “We wish to have a youth league that is led by its rightful owners because if one body part is limping or is having challenges it affects the entire youth progressive formations and in this case obviously we will play our support. We will work very close to the appointed leadership and indeed we just hope that they are not to allow to be drawn into the factional battles of the congress movement that we have already,” says YCLSA National Secretary, Tinyiko Ntini. ANC top officials, including the party President, Cyril Ramaphosa, and its Secretary General, Ace Magashule, have met with the 34-member team. The structure, which is mandated to take the ANC Youth League to congress, held its first meeting this weekend. The meeting received a report from the outgoing collective and will adapt resolutions to chart a new way forward. “The ANC NYTT has had its meeting from Friday when we started the induction from comrade Kgalema Motlanthe and then we continued with discussions. Yesterday (Saturday), we had the president of the ANC talking to us; giving us his political input and he gave us advice on what needs to be done going forward and retaining the ANCYL and its members,” ANC NYTT Spokesperson, Sizophila Mkhize. Discussions at the weekend-long meeting included the disbandment of ANC Youth League structures in provinces and regions. The task team will brief members of the media on Monday on the outcomes of the meeting. ANC top officials meet with newly elected National Youth Task Team:
