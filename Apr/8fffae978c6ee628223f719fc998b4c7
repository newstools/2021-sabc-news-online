The US Capitol building in Washington DC and surrounding streets are under lockdown after police warned of an “external security threat.” A US Capitol Police officer has died from injuries suffered in Friday’s vehicle attack at the Capitol complex, police said. The suspect has also died, they added at a briefing. Previously, Capitol Police said a suspect is in custody after reports that someone “rammed a vehicle” into two officers. The suspect and both officers had been taken to hospital. It is believed the suspect stabbed at least one of the injured officers. A video from outside the Capitol shows a vehicle that appears to have slammed into a barricade surrounding the complex. There is a heavy police presence in the area. In January, the Capitol came under siege by supporters of former President Donald Trump on the day Congress ratified the result declaring Joe Biden the victor in the Presidential election. Acting Police Chief Yogananda D Pittman addressed reporters on the situation. US Capitol building under lockdown after security threat:
