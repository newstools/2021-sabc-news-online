The State Capture Commission of Inquiry continues to hear evidence relating to State Security, from former Minister David Mahlobo, on Friday afternoon. Earlier in the day, Mahlobo testified that he had no involvement in the operational matters of the State Security Agency, contrary to earlier testimony of some SSA officials. He added however, that the law does not define the role of the minister.
