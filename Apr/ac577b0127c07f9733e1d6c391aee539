The 14-year-old Mbilwi Secondary School learner who is seen in a video repeatedly slapping fellow learner, Lufuno Mavhunga, is expected to apply for bail on Thursday morning in the Thohoyandou Children’s Court in Limpopo. The grade 10 learner faces a charge of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Mavhunga later overdosed on pills and died. The minor’s case is being held in camera, with only the state, the probation officer, her family and the defence present in the courtroom. Her legal representative Kagiso Muthivhithivhi says they want her to be released into her mother’s custody as she is not coping at the secure care centre where she is being held. “We are talking about a child who comes from a great family, great family support and she has never been in conflict with the law. This is the first time that she has been removed and placed somewhere, where she is not in the comfort of her mother, her siblings so she is not doing particularly good, she is not doing that good.” On Tuesday, the case did not sit due to the non-availability of a magistrate. SABC News reporter Pimani Baloyi speak about the assault incident:  Disappointed The family of a grade 10 learner say they are disappointed at the school’s handling of the matter. They say a preliminary report from the school shows Lufuno and the learner who assaulted her were taken to the principal’s office by security immediately after the incident. Lufuno’s family speaks out: Funeral service Mavhunga’s funeral service took place over the weekend, where she was described as a dedicated learner whose ambition was to become a doctor so that she could empower rural communities. One of the mourners called on the country’s leaders to come up with solutions to bullying. Funeral service below:
