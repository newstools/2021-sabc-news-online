Two more suspects are expected to appear in the Upington Magistrateâ€™s Court on Monday in connection with the cash-in-transit heist that took place in Upington last Tuesday. The robbery took place at the Kalahari Mall where five men allegedly robbed two security guards when they were loading money into an ATM. Police say about R40 million was taken during the incident. The Hawks arrested the second suspect on Friday and a joint operation by the agency and crime intelligence led to the arrest of a third suspect on Saturday in the Free State. An undisclosed amount of money was also recovered. The Hawks say investigations are ongoing and further arrests are imminent.
