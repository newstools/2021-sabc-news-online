The chairperson of the joint committee on defence, Cyril Xaba, says they expect to hear from President Cyril Ramaphosa this week, regarding the deployment of South African National Defence Force (SANDF) personnel to Mozambique. Last week, the Presidency announced that soldiers were being deployed to Palma to secure the safety of South Africans after ISIS linked insurgents killed scores of people. One South African was among those who lost their lives. In line with the Constitution, the President should promptly inform Parliament of all details of a deployment. Xaba says they expect to hear the details, such as the reason and duration of the deployment soon. “The committee has interpreted the word ‘promptly’ to mean without unreasonable delay. So, I think the President is within his time to inform Parliament. Hence we expect to inform Parliament at any time during the course of the week of the details of the deployment,” explains Xaba.
