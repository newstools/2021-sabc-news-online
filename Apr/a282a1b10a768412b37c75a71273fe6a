Apple Inc said on Friday that it is starting a programme to help employees get voluntary COVID-19 vaccinations at the iPhone makerâ€™s offices. The company is working with drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc as its vendor and will open a website for its workers to sign up for appointments, an Apple spokesperson said. Apple is one of the first large Silicon Valley companies to launch a programme to help workers get vaccinated. Deutsche Bank AG earlier this month became the first big bank in New York to say it would offer employees COVID-19 vaccinations at its offices. Last month, Amazon.com Inc started onsite vaccinations for front-line employees, starting in Missouri, Nevada and Kansas.
