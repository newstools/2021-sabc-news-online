Former Eskom senior manager France Hlakudi’s application to have fraud removed from his charge sheet has been dismissed by the Pretoria Regional Court. Hlakudi had brought an application last month to have the charge removed. Hlakudi is charged with contravening the Tax Administration Act in his personal capacity and as director of the companies for allegedly not declaring his income. He faces 44 charges of tax fraud to the tune of R30 million. In dismissing the application, Magistrate Adriaan Bekker said the prosecution’s preferred charges against Hlakudi had been clearly set out. Bekker says there is a legal duty on the individual to declare and submit tax returns and charges against Hlakudi are based on his nonsubmission of tax returns. Bekker says the defence’s submissions are baseless. He further says there is no basis in law for Hlakudi’s application. The matter was then postponed to the 24th of next month.
