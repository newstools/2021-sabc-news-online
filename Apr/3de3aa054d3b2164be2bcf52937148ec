The African Centre for Diseases Control (CDC) says the pockets of conflicts in Africa will derail the fight against COVID-19 and access to vaccines. Speaking during the weekly media briefing,  Africa CDC Director Dr John Nkengasong also commented on the vaccine passport. Dr Nkengasong says conflict doesn’t bode well with fighting a virus:  Meanwhile, Tunisia has approved the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, Health minister Faouzi Mehdi said and will soon receive 1.5 million doses under an African Union plan. The African Union has dropped plans to buy vaccines from the Serum Institute of India and is exploring options with Johnson &Johnson.
