The United Nations has reiterated and reinforced its commitment to continue working closely with the successor of Tanzania’s late President John Magufuli. The UN Chief Antonio Guterres has paid tribute to Magufuli at a memorial service hosted by the UN in the United States. Magufuli was laid to rest in his ancestral village after his sudden death in March. He has been succeeded by Samia Suluhu Hassan. Guterres says Magufuli was a champion of economic development in Tanzania. “His government also improved rural edification in the country with ambitions to expand Tanzania’s electricity generation capacity to enable nationwide energy excess. On behalf of the United Nations, we once again offer our condolences to the late president’s family, the government and people of Tanzania.” He continued by pledging support for the East African country. “We recognise the country’s long history of support for multilateralism and applaud its dedication to international and regional cooperation. We stand with the people of Tanzania to advance sustainable development and support their aspirations for a prosperous Tanzania for all.”
