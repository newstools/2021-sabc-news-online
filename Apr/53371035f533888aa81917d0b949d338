Gauteng South African Municipal Workers Union Deputy Secretary, Mamorena Madisha, has given the assurance that their strike which will start at Rand Water on Wednesday will take place within the confines of the law. The focus of the strike is expected to be at Rand Water’s head office in Glenvista in the south of Johannesburg. On Monday, the employer formally received notification of an industrial strike. Samwu claims Rand Water unilaterally changed the terms of employment for workers. The union is demanding a R4000 salary increase for all workers who fall under the Local Government Bargaining Council. Madisha says the strike will start on Wednesday morning. “We don’t involve ourselves in criminal activity. That we cannot do. All we are saying is that any member who is a member of Samwu, come Wednesday they obviously are on strike. We will of course converge at the head office that is where we are all going to converge.” In the video below, Samwu accuses Rand Water of unilaterally cancelling workers performance bonuses: Not protected Rand Water says the strike by Samwu is not protected and all employees are expected to report for duty on Wednesday. The water utility supplies water to municipalities and industries in Gauteng, the North West, Mpumalanga and the Free State. Rand Water’s Teboho Joala says they have put contingency plans in place to ensure a sustained supply of water to customers.  #strikeaction [LE] pic.twitter.com/CUUEpiqaPN — Rand Water (@Rand_Water) April 19, 2021
