The Western Cape Transport Department has called for calm in the taxi industry, following the murder of Chairperson of the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association Victor Wiwi. He was gunned down when he was with a colleague near Nyanga last week. Wiwi was shot when he was returning from a meeting out of town where he had intervened in a dispute between taxi associations. Provincial Transport Minister Bonginkosi Madikizela says, “We mustn’t speculate and that is the message that I was communicating to the associations. We mustn’t start to point fingers and suspect each other, let us allow the police to do their work and find the perpetrators. We are prioritising this, I have been talking to my colleague Minister Albert Fritz so that we can get to the bottom of this and hopefully these perpetrators will be brought to book.” Western Cape Transport calls for calm:
