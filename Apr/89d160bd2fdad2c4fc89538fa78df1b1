ANC veteran and former uMkonto weSizwe soldier Joel Mbhazima Sibiya is expected to be buried in an official provincial funeral category number two on Sunday morning at his home village of Mahatlani outside Giyani in Limpopo. Sibiya, who was exiled in Mozambique and received military training in Angola and Germany, died after a short illness in hospital. He was 66. Sibiya also served in Parliament as a member of the National Council of Provinces. ANC provincial spokesperson Donald Selamolela says, “We see this as befitting because comrade Joel spent the rest of his life serving humanity, joined MK, received training in Angola, received (training) in Germany and many other parts of the world.” “Post the democratic breakthrough in 1994, comrade Joel continued to serve the people of South Africa in various capacities, comrade Joel Sibiya was a commissar of MK, a leader of unparallel credentials, a committed soldier of the liberation struggle.”
