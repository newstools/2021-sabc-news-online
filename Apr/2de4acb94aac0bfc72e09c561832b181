Expelled PAC president, Luthando Mbinda, and two co-accused are expected back in the Bellville Commercial Crimes Court in Cape Town on the 19th of next month on fraud charges. Mbinda and his alleged accomplices face fraud and theft charges amounting to R2.4-million. Mbinda, Gcobani Katiya and Edward Mfulane allegedly opened bank accounts under the name of the PAC after he had been expelled. He appeared in court on Thursday after handing himself over to the Hawks. Hawks spokesperson, Philani Nkwalase says the accused requested that the funds owed to PAC be transferred to a new account. “Thereafter, the accused informed the finance department of Parliament that the funds owed to the PAC be transferred to the newly opened bank account as opposed to the existing bank account of the party at Parliament.”
