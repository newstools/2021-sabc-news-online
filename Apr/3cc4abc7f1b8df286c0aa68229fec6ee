The Higher Education Department has expressed concern that students who have been exposed to the coronavirus could trigger a third wave of infections after the Easter holidays. About 115 students have tested positive for the virus since March19. Professor Ramneek Ahluwalia from the Department’s wellness and development centre, Higher Health says, “So as much as efforts have been made, 3 000 people have been screened; student and staff have been tested. The challenge is we might have missed those who would have been in high-risk areas and contact and would have passed back into their families and communities while they carry this virus.” Seven hundred and seventy-seven new coronavirus infections have been recorded in South Africa in the latest 24-hour cycle, putting the cumulative number of cases at 1 551 501. The Health Department also reported eight more COVID-19-related deaths, taking the total since the outbreak of the pandemic to 52 954. The total number of recoveries is 1 476 605.
