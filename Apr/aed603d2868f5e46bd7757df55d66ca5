Counselling psychologist, Nthabiseng Ramothwala says bullies also need help, because they come from a point of weakness and are constantly trying to prove themselves by putting down others. Commenting on the bullying case involving the now deceased learner, Lufuno Mavhunga from Mbilwi Secondary School in Sibasa, outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo, Ramothwala says people who end up bullying others are usually products of their environment and circumstances. She adds that “Bullies are wounded people, becoming a bully is something that develops over time.” The Psychologist suggests that instead of condemning them, they should be rehabilitated as a way of stopping the process because if they do not get help, their bullying continues. Parents’ role Ramathwala says parents need to play their role in mentoring their children on how to resolve conflict. She says “It’s important for parents to realise that whatever method you teach your child to fight (back) should not be a method that is violent, because most parents only know violence from their background. So, they will teach their children what they know.” She advises that if a learner is being bullied in a school environment, the best approach is to report the matter to the principal of the school. Ramothwala spoke to SAfm: The Talking Point with Cathy Mohlahlana on Thursday.
