Vodacom has donated R3 million to support relief efforts and to contribute towards humanitarian aid following the devastating Table Mountain fire that started at the weekend. Vodacom says the funds are aimed at restoring the historic Jagger Library at the University of Cape Town that was extensively damaged by the inferno. Group CEO, Shameel Joosub, says the donation is also to assist the Western Cape government with rescue operations following the blaze. Joosub says the operator will fix fire damage to its communication sites and network at its own cost. Western Cape Premier is visiting Roeland Street Fire Station:  Structural engineers and firefighters are continuing with assessments at the Jagger Library. One man has appeared in court and two others are being sought in connection with the fire that damaged several buildings on UCT’s Upper campus. The blaze initially started on the upper slopes of the mountain above UCT on Sunday. About 4 000 students had to be evacuated and moved to temporary accommodation venues. UCT has suspended classes for the rest of the week. Properties not spared The house of Labour Minister, Thulas Nxesi, is one of the properties gutted by the raging mountain fire. The homes of three other members of cabinet also had to be evacuated in Warmer Estate early Monday morning. Spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Works, Zara Nicholson, says no one was hurt. “The department is in contact with various ministries to determine the level of support that the families need but they have all managed to secure alternate accommodation and we have informed them to notify the department if they need any further assistance, SAPS has advised these families not to return to their homes as it is not completely safe to do so. In Groote Schuur Estate on Sunday the fire has come close to the Deputy President’s house in Cape,” says Nicholson.
