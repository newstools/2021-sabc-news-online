Members of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance of South Africa are at the Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court in KwaMashu to support the family of the Sphamandla Khoza. Khoza was stabbed to death last month in what his family is calling a hate crime, allegedly over his sexuality. Today, accused Thando Mgenge is expected to make a formal bail application. Mgenge handed himself over to police following the incident. GLASA secretary Frank Gazu says, “We want Thando Mgenge to be denied bail, he is a threat to society, he is a threat to the LGBTQI Plus community and I think him handing himself over was not an act of remorse. He bowed from pressure of the community and the community outcry.” “There is no act of remorse, therefore, we call on the justice system to deny him bail. I think what needs to be done is to speed up the process of the implementation of the Hate Crimes Bill of 2018 and we’ve been calling for the introduction of the LGBTQI Plus offenders register similar to that of GBV register.” In the video below, GLASA calls for Khoza not to get bail
