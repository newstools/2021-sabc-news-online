The first Premier of KwaZulu-Natal, Dr Frank Mdlalose, has passed away. The news was broken by Mdlalose’s political home, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) on Saturday night. Mdlolose became the head of the KwaZulu-Natal government after the ANC won the country’s first democratic elections in 1994. “It is with deep sadness that the IFP announces the passing of our former National Chairperson, Dr Frank Mdlalose, who has succumbed to COVID-19. We extend our condolences to his daughter, Ms Makhosazana Mdlalose, and to his wife who is currently in hospital fighting this virus. We pray for her and we wish her strength,” says the party in a statement. Described as an outstanding servant of South Africa, Mdlalose has served in the former KwaZulu government as the Minister of the Interior and then Minister of Health. “During the constitutional negotiations, he became one of the IFP’s main negotiators, and was our country’s champion for federalism and the creation of provinces. When South Africa achieved democracy in 1994 and the electorate placed KwaZulu-Natal under the governance of the IFP, we appointed Dr Mdlalose as the first Premier of the Province,” says the IFP. He relinquished his premiership and IFP national chairperson position due to ill health, handing the premiership baton over to Dr Ben Ngubane who later joined the ANC. “We were proud when the national Government appointed Dr Mdlalose as South Africa’s Ambassador to Egypt. Again, he served with distinction,” the IFP adds. The party has sent its condolences to the Mdlalose family, adding that it wishes that “this great patriot rests in peace.” Global COVID-19 Wrap:
