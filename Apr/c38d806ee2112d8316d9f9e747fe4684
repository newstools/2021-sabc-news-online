The Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court has denied bail to Thando Mgenge, the man charged with the brutal murder of Sphamandla Khoza at the beginning of April. In his ruling, Magistrate Amos Mchunu mentioned the excessive violence during the murder and that Khoza was stabbed all over his body. It has emerged that a security guard found Khoza’s hidden body after following a trail of blood. Magistrate Mchunu said that Mgenge is facing a very serious charge and that he is a threat to witnesses. Mchunu has pointed out that Mgenge is not showing any remorse. The case has been postponed to May 31 for further investigation. Judgment in the bail application of Thando Mgenge:  Meanwhile, various organizations advocating for the rights of the LGBTQI community have appealed to the presidency to protect them. LGBTQI+ member Hlengiwe Buthelezi says, “We have called on the presidency to tackle this issue directly not just to mention because it was Freedom Day. We want the attention, we are being killed. As we are here for Spha, there was another person who was killed 3 days back, meaning these killings are still going on…” “We, therefore, say the President must not just mention us along with other things. He must give us special attention. I mean, how many lives must be lost before the president or all the leadership in this country attend to this,” says Buthelezi.
