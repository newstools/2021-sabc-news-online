The ANC has reiterated its support for the State Capture Commission ahead of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s appearance before the commission on Wednesday. Ramaphosa, who will testify in his capacity as ANC president, is expected to be questioned about his tenure as deputy president of the ANC and the country.

Mokonyane also touched on the party’s step aside resolution, describing it as a sensitive issue. The resolution stipulates that ANC members who are charged with serious crimes including corruption should step aside until their court cases are finalised.
