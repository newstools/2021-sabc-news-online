Former Nelson Mandela Bay African National Congress (ANC) councillor, Andile Lungisa says he is studying the ruling by the High Court in Gqeberha, that he must pay R844 000 in damages to Democratic Alliance (DA) councillor Rayno Kayser. Kayser instituted a civil claim after Lungisa hit him over the head with a glass jug during a council brawl in 2016. Earlier Kayser said he is satisfied with the court’s decision. “I think from the onset I was very clear that I put my trust in the criminal justice system and until Friday, from the magistrates’ court, the High Court in Grahamstown, the SCA, the Constitutional court and the PE court did not fail me in executing their responsibilities,” said Kayser. Lungisa maintains he assaulted the DA councillor in self-defence:  Lungisa was sentenced to two years in jail for assault but was released on parole after serving two months of his sentence.
Lungisa says he was not aware that the matter was in court. “I was told about the outcome of this judgement, I was not aware this case was on. I will read the judgement with my legal team, I will appeal this judgement. If we are not successful, I have two cats, they can take one of my cats.”
