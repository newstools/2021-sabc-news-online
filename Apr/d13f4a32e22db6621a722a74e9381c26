African National Congress (ANC) president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has told the State Capture Commission of Inquiry that the ANC has, over the course of several years, recognised the existence of corruption within the state, its own ranks and other parts of society. He added that the party could, and should, have done more to prevent the abuse of power and resources. Ramaphosa continues with his testimony at the commission on Wednesday afternoon.
