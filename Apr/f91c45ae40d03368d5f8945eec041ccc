Former ANC chairperson and North West premier Supra Mahumapelo has arrived at the Delareyville Town Hall where he is set to brief branches about his suspension and that of other prominent ANC members by the party’s Interim Provincial Committee (IPC). He is joined by ANC Women’s League Provincial Secretary, Bitsa Lenkopane, who is also facing disciplinary charges. Mahumapelo’s ANC membership was suspended earlier in the week after he allegedly told JB Marks Local Municipality Mayor Kgotso Khumalo, not to step aside over the fraud and corruption cloud that’s hanging over his head. Mahumapelo’s supporters cry foul following his suspension:  Mahumapelo is a Member of Parliament and is one of five other North West ANC members, including Premier Job Mokgoro, who are  facing a DC in the province. Mokgoro has, however, indicated that he will not form part of today’s meeting. The Premier had his ANC membership suspended for allegedly going against the mandate of the ANC when voting for a new chair of chairs in the provincial legislature.
