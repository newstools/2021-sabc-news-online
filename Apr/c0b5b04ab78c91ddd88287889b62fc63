The Democratic Alliance (DA) has launched an online petition opposing the timing of the renaming of Johannesburg’s William Nicol Drive to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Drive. A public participation process is underway into the proposed renaming of William Nicol Drive which the DA says will be a costly undertaking amid the coronavirus pandemic. DA Provincial Legislative Member Nico De Jager says, “We are not opposed to the name Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, but the timing – due to the impact that COVID-19 will have on businesses…” “All we are saying is that the right time to do that, especially with the cost implications on the economy with the change of a name when there is so much more than can be done with that money,” added De Jager. The City is considering re-naming William Nicol Drive to Winnie Madikizela Mandela Drive. You’re invited to comment on the renaming. Please use contacts on the poster to engage on this process #JoburgUpdates ^NS pic.twitter.com/QockRmaIXS — City of Joburg (@CityofJoburgZA) March 24, 2021
