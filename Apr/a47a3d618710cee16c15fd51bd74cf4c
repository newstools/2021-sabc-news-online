The Ntuzuma Magistrate’s Court north of Durban is expected to hand down judgment on Wednesday on the bail application of the man accused of killing Sphamandla Khoza. Thando Mgenge allegedly stabbed to death Khoza multiple times last month apparently because he was gay. During Mgenge’s last appearance, he told the court that he will not evade trial since he handed himself to police. The accused told the court that he has also cooperated with police and also gave them most of the evidence they will need during the trial stage.

They said the court needs to protect their community as hate crimes towards the LGBTQI+ community is seemingly on the rise in the country.
