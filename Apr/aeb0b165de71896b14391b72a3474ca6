The African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa will pay tribute to struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela on the third anniversary of her death on Friday. Ramaphosa will deliver a keynote address at a wreath-laying ceremony at the grave of Madikizela-Mandela at the Fourways Memorial Park, north of Johannesburg, where he will be joined by members of the Mandela family and other ANC national leaders. After the wreath-laying ceremony, they will proceed to Mama Winnieâ€™s church, the Meadowlands Methodist Church in Soweto, for a church service. Both events will comply with COVID regulations, with a limited number of people allowed access to both services.
