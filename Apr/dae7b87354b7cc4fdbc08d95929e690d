Professor Zeblon Zenzele Vilakazi was on Thursday installed as the 16th Vice-Chancellor and Principal of Wits University at a ceremony held at the Great Hall. In his address, Vilakazi emphasised on the importance of universities and strong public institutions in society. Vilakazi says universities play a huge role in developing active social citizens, leaders, intellectuals, innovators, and critical thinkers. “We must focus on developing academically excellent graduates who leave their mark on society; we must continue to conduct world-class research and foster innovation and entrepreneurship; and we must use our location in the economic heartland of Africa to lead from the Global South.” #WitsNewVC: “Diamonds are created under conditions of great pressure.

You do not usher in a vision in a moment of euphoria. You do it because the vision you are articulating is as important as the other challenges which must be overcome,” adds Vilakazi. Vilakazi grew up in Katlehong, in Ekurhuleni. An interview with the Wits University Vice-Chancellor and Principal below:
