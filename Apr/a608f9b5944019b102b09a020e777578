South Africans have expressed concern about South Africa’s procurement of more than 50-million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. On Thursday, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize announced that the country has secured the vaccines from pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. Minister Mkhize reveals expected arrival dates of COVID-19 vaccines:  Delivery is expected to begin later in April. Some citizens say, while the procurement will help fight the coronavirus, they are concerned about how government will pay for these vaccines. “I have mixed feeling(s) about it, it’s a good thing but at the same time our country is getting into more debt. Unless the process is not corrupted and we see it through seamlessly, then I will pat them on the back and say great job,” says one of the persons interviewed. “I do think that the [vaccination roll-out] rate needs to improve, we need to get the vaccines to people quicker. I’m also worried about the cost of getting these vaccines. Where is the money coming from,” says another concerned citizen. “I think it’s a good thing, I think it’s a bit delayed. One of my biggest things is, if you look at a normal flu, if the flu vaccines doesn’t work 100%, what are the chances of this working 100%,” explains another person.
