The case of a 32-year-old man accused of being the mastermind behind the murder of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule has been postponed to April 26 in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court, west of Johannesburg. Ntuthuko Shoba appeared in court on Thursday morning for a second attempt at bail. Police arrested Shoba at his home in Florida earlier this year, after the man convicted of the murder of Pule, entered into a plea agreement with the state to testify against Shoba. Tshegofatso Pule’s uncle speaks to the media:  In June 2020, Pule’s body was found in an open field in Roodepoort. She was eight months pregnant at the time. During the court proceedings, Shoba listened attentively to the state attorney as he detailed cellphone records which showed that on the day of Pule’s murder, Shoba had contacted Mzikayise Malephane 23 times from an unregistered phone. The state is detailing contradictions in Shoba’s version of events. The court also heard the contents of a WhatsApp conversation between Shoba and Pule which revealed that Shoba was not happy about her pregnancy and may have tried to harm the baby.
