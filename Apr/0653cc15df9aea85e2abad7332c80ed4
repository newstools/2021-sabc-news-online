A memorial service for 15-year-old Lufuno Mavhunga has begun. It is being held at her school, Mbilwi Secondary School, in Limpopo. Mavhunga took her life on Monday after a video of her being assaulted by a fellow learner went viral on social media. Fly high, little Princess Dear Lufuno, you are not too much or too little, but you are more than enough. You do make a difference. You are a Queen. Spread your wings. We love you. Rest in Power #womenforchange #RIPLufuno#lufunomavhunga pic.twitter.com/uoVVQMwI6x — Women For Change (@womenforchange5) April 15, 2021  She has been described as a peace-loving child.  Her assault sparked public outcry, with the hashtag #JusticeForLufuno trending on social media. It also reignited the debate on violence in South Africa. The bullying behaviour by school children towards their peers is mainly a reflection of how parents treat each at home and of course our system, children are best students they learn what they see at home and practice same on their fellow schoolmates. #LufunoMavhunga RIP pic.twitter.com/hwFeK2JNBk — Matsidikanye Moswane (@matsi_moswane) April 15, 2021  Her assailant is appearing in court today. She faces an assault charge. Several other learners who are said to have egged her on during the assault face suspension from school.

Imagine trying to convince yourself every morning that you are beautiful, smart, strong, worthy & enough. But it doesn’t take others much to kill your self-esteem.

I’ve been a victim of bullying and that’s why this incident has triggered trauma. Imagine being voted the second ugliest girl in high school. I’m that girl. For the longest time I never felt beautiful because of what was said to me & about me continously — Reneilwe Dhludhlu Mtima xx (@ReeDhludhlu) April 15, 2021  People are beautiful in the own way ~ Lufuno Mavhunga #lufunomavhunga pic.twitter.com/Xs5QoDdVuT — BrownSkinGirl mf.
