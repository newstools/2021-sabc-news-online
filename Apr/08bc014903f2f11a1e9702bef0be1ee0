Lobby groups AfriForum and Solidarity have welcomed the High Court in Pretoria’s ruling that interdicted government from processing applications or making payments from its Tourism Equity Fund. The R1.2 billion fund was announced earlier in 2021, to assist tourism businesses that have been struggling due to the lockdown regulations and to help with the establishment of new businesses in the sector. The video below is reporting that businesses in the tourism sector are to benefit from the R1.2 billion cash injection  Solidarity and AfriForum have challenged the fund’s criteria which only allow for predominantly black-owned enterprises to apply. The groups say the pandemic does not discriminate against anyone on the basis of race but that the disaster is being exploited by government to only provide funds to BEE businesses. AfriForum’s campaign manager Jacques Broodryk welcomed the ruling. “This ruling is [a] major victory against the ANC government’s institutional racism against minorities. The racist Tourism Fund proves the seriousness of the government’s racial ideology infection, and the only immune system capable of fighting the government’s immoral racial discrimination seems to be fearless civil rights watchdogs such as AfriForum and Solidarity,” explains Broodryk.
