The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is expected to announce the results of Wednesday’s by-elections later on Thursday. The elections were held in seven provinces to replace councillors who had either died or had been removed from office by their parties. The IEC’s Deputy Chief Electoral Officer Mashego Sheburi says the elections went smoothly and that counting started on Wednesday night as planned. Buffalo City Metro Municipal by-elections progressed well in different parts of the country with an exception of Ward 20 in the Buffalo City Metro. The by-election was cancelled as the incumbent councillor obtained a court interdict against her removal from the Buffalo City Council by CoGTA MEC Xolile Nqatha. MEC Nqatha fired Ntombizodwa Gamnca after she was convicted for robbery and intimidation in the East London Magistrate’s Court. Gamnca was given a four-year suspended sentence and a R10 000 fine. She was fired for contravening the Councillors’ Code of Conduct. Gamnca wants the court to review CoGTA’s decision to fire her. By-elections in KwaZulu-Natal: Additional reporting by Lubabalo Dada.
