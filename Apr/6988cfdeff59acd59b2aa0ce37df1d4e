Three doctors and a nurse have been suspended at the Bernice Samuel Hospital in Delmas, Mpumalanga. Their suspension comes after an infant had her hand amputated following admission for a case of diarrhoea. Mbali Swelene (21) says Medical staff decided to insert a drip for the two-week-old infant because she was dehydrated. A few days later, her daughter’s hand started turning purple. Upon questioning nursing staff, she was repeatedly assured that the hand would return to normal. The baby’s arm was amputated a few days later at Witbank Hospital. Mpumalanga mother seeks answers after her baby’s hand is amputated:  Delmas community members marched to the Bernice Samuel Hospital after pictures of the baby’s infected arm, before amputation, went viral. The Mpumalanga provincial authorities have admitted to a possible case of negligence. On Monday, Health MEC Sasekani Manzini said investigations are under way and corrective measures will be taken. “Of course we can’t correct what has happened, but justice must be served.” A preliminary report into the matter is expected this week. Both mother and child remain in hospital. Three doctors and a nurse suspended over infant hand’s amputation:
