Former President, Jacob Zuma, has been struck another legal blow after his lawyers, Mabuza Attorneys announced that they will no longer be representing him. The move comes three weeks before the start of his corruption trial at the Pietermaritzburg High Court in KwaZulu-Natal. Mabuza Attorneys filed a notice of withdrawal with Pietermaritzburg High Court this morning. The withdrawal also comes at a time when Zuma has lost the Supreme Court Appeals judgment on the state paying for his legal bill. This may result on Zuma’s day in court being moved, as he now has to find new attorneys who need to get a brief and familiarise themselves with the arms deal case. The former president is accused of have received bribes from a French arms firm, Thales International, through his financial adviser in order to protect the company from scrutiny. He faces corruption, racketeering, fraud and money laundering charges related to the matter. Zuma denies the claims against him. The former president also faces a possible sanction from the Constitutional Court after he defied an order to appear before the commission probing allegations of state capture, which is alleged to have happened during his tenure as the head of government. While the governing ANC has encouraged him to comply with the laws of the country, Zuma feels let down by some high-ranking members of the organisation. More on that in the video below:
