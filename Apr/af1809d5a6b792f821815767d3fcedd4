The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Social Development has intervened in a matter involving a Durban family and a Metro police officer. It is alleged that the officer assaulted two teenage boys, after accusing them of stealing from his Savannah Park home. The officer located the children following the alleged robbery and pointed his service pistol at them and forced them to drink petrol. KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Social Development Nonhlanhla Khoza says the incident has left the children, who are believed to have special needs, traumatised. A charge has been laid against the officer at the Marianhill police station west of Durban.
