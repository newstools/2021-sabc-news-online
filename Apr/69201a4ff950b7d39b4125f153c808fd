Traditional Leaders Organisation (Contralesa) President, Kgosi Lameck Mokoena, says they are still talking to the Department of Health to plan for the start of the initiation season this year. Mokoena says last year they experienced a lot of challenges from people who were not adhering to the COVID-19 regulations. Mokoena says they have so far received a lot of applications from people who want to operate initiation schools this year. “Our intention is that initiation schools will continue. However, it won’t just continue without any plan. As I am talking to you now, we have received so many applications from people who want to open the school. What we are doing now, we are busy with discussions with the department to look into some of the challenges that need to be addressed before the school can be opened.” In December, Contralesa halted the issuing of permits to initiation schools. It said members in all provinces would monitor the initiation schools that were already in progress, to ensure compliance to COVID-19 health and safety guidelines.
