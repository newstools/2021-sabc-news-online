Going to miss you.  pic.twitter.com/6F7DFawZWG — Ian Goetham (@IanGoetham) April 25, 2021  Goethan joined Jacana in 2015 as a production manager. In her short bio, she says she was soon bitten by the publishing bug and she moved to chasing authors and stories. Talking about her loves, she said: “Nothing beats that feeling you get when I see a first-time author’s face light up when they see and hold their book for the first time. I literally have the chance to help make people’s dreams come true.” Some of those who knew and worked with her are describing her passing as a huge loss to the literary industry. One of my biggest cheerleaders, kept bullies away from me, was one of my strongest crutches. So lost. I love you Nadia. Rest my friend. https://t.co/NeagMz3j0a — Thabiso M.
