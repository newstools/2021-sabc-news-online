Large numbers of people are heading to their Easter destinations as the long weekend gets underway. In the Eastern Cape, Health MEC Nomakhosazana Meth says Emergency Medical Services will be on high alert. There are concerns that a third wave of the coronavirus could result from people travelling and not observing coronavirus protocols. South Africans are urged to continue wearing masks, practicing social distancing and regular hand washing or sanitising to avoid spreading COVID 19.  MEC Meth joined law enforcement agencies and emergency personnel on the N2 road between Kei Bridge and Butterworth to help warn people about the continued risk of coronavirus. “We are here with the EMS team so that when we are needed in the unfortunate event we are able to respond on time, we know that people will be moving up and down visiting their families and going to churches so we are here to reinforce work of government to make sure that our services are available when it is needed.” Meanwhile, traffic volumes on major roads leaving Gauteng are increasing steadily as people make their way to their Easter destinations.  Gauteng Traffic police spokesperson, Obed Sibasa, says they’ve deployed officers along the routes to other provinces. He’s urged motorists to obey the rules of the road and to take regular breaks when doing long distance travel. “We have deployed officers all over. They will be out to monitor lawlessness. To speedsters, drunk drivers, reckless and neglect driving they will be immediately arrested. So far we have not recorded any fatalities however one was recorded of a pedestrian on the N12 in the South of Joburg.”
