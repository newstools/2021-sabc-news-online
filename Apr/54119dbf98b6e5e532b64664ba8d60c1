Political analyst Andre Duvenhage says the African National Congress (ANC) North West Interim Provincial Committee’s decision to suspend Supra Mahumapelo is politically motivated. North West former premier and former ANC provincial chairperson Mahumapelo’s party membership has been temporarily suspended after he allegedly instructed JB Marks Local Municipal mayor Kgotso Khumalo not to resign. The IPC earlier requested Khumalo to resign as he’s facing fraud and corruption charges. Duvenhage says the action against Mahumapelo will further deepen divisions within the province. “Mr Supra Mahumapelo is having a lot of support at the grass-root level and he has fierce competition going on with Hlomane Chauke and Nono Maloi and that they will do the utmost to isolate him politically, maybe justifiably. But clearly is also a lot of politics behind it and I believe that the fight within the ANC is still on its way.” Mahumapelo is yet to react to the party’s decision to temporarily suspend his ANC membership. Reinstatement In 2019, the High Court in Pretoria ordered the ANC in the North West to reinstate Mahumapelo as the provincial chairperson. The same court set aside the decision to disband the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). FILE VIDEO: Mahumapelo on winning the ANC North West PEC court battle:
