South Africans celebrate Freedom Day 2021 under the adjusted lockdown Level 1 regulation. The freedom to protest amid a pandemic According to the Constitution, citizens are free to take part in peaceful protests. In March 2021, students across the country took to the streets to express their frustrations after some of them were unable to register for the 2021 academic year over financial exclusion. The protests saw several universities and TVET colleges across the country suspending lessons as the protests gathered momentum. But the fees protest took the worst turn after a bystander, Mthokozisi Ntumba, was shot and killed allegedly by the police, earlier in March. Ntumba was struck by a rubber bullet while leaving a nearby clinic in Braamfontein. The incident drew criticism from different sectors of the society, with some criticising the police for denying the students their freedom to protest.
