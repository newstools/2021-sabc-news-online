A corruption case against three suspects, a Lieutenant Colonel from the Hawks in Gauteng, a Head of Department of Human Settlements in Mpumalanga and a senior member of the National Prosecuting Authority will be heard at the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. It is alleged that they wanted a case of fraud and contravention of the Immigration Act against the Mpumalanga head of department withdrawn and that money and alcohol exchanged hands to influence such a decision. NPA spokesperson Sipho Ngwema says an internal process against the accused prosecutor has been started. “Certainly also on our side the internal labour processes already have kicked started but also the auditing of the relevant cases that apply to the individual implicated in the case just to make sure that from a risk management point of view similar conduct if any is or is not or did not extend to other cases that may have been under the management of our colleague who is implicated in this case.” Hawks spokesperson Katlego Mogale says some cases will be taken over by other Hawks members. “I believe that once they were granted bail it would be that, internally our processes will have to kick start, which means some of the cases that the Colonel was in charge of will be redistributed to other members to take care of them.”
