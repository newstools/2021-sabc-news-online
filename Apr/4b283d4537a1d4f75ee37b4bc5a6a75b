The family of a 15-year-old grade 10 learner at Nkoneni Secondary School in Tshiendeulu Village, outside Louis Trichardt in Limpopo, says it has been forced to remove its child from the school due to a bullying incident. The teenager is said to have developed an eye problem after a 21-year-old fellow learner allegedly splashed him with a washing powder fume on the his eyes in 2020. The 15-year-old boy’s parents say the alleged perpetrator’s family was asked, through the school, to pay a R110 transport fare to hospital, but nothing has come out of that request. “I gave the school management an invoice of money spent to Siloam Hospital and they just said they will attend to the matter but all in vain. I reminded the school principal that the matter is unfinished and she did not attend to it too,” says the boy’s parent. “This year on the 10th of February, I removed [the child] from the school because the principal was not attending to it [the alleged bullying]. I was at peace that it [the problem] was resolved after I took him out of the school. However, there is now a problem because he is not feeling well,” adds the parent. Meanwhile, the 14-year-old grade 10 learner from Mbilwi High School who is accused of assaulting a 15-year-old Lufuno Mavhunga, who later took her own life, is out on bail. She was granted R1 500 by the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court in Limpopo. Kids News tackles the issue of bullying in the video below:
