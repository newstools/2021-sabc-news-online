A 62-year-old man, arrested for alleged fraud and corruption involving a multi-million rand tender scam, has been granted bail by the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court, east of Johannesburg. Manuel Teixeira was arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation team in Germiston. Teixeira, Director of Cornerstone and the Blue Kit IT company, allegedly inflated invoices which resulted in an actual loss of approximately R130 million for the network service provider, Cell C, between 2012 and 2019. “It is alleged that Teixeira together with his co-accused Mohamed Admjee, Lufuno Nevhutalu and Adriaan Pillay colluded and inflated rates for IT and network services required by Cell C. Teixeira handed himself over to the Hawks and faces charges of fraud and corruption. He has been granted bail of R50 000 by the Palm Ridge Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. The case has been postponed to April 14th when he will join his co-accused who are already out on bail.”
