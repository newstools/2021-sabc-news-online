A ten million rand multi-purpose centre has been handed over to the community of Reeston in Buffalo City metro, by the Department of Human Settlements in the Eastern Cape. However, some residents in the area believe the funds spent on this project could have been used to bring about much needed basic services. They claim that basic services such as access to water, housing, proper roads and health facilities are few and far between. A multi-purpose centre handed over to Reeston community:  ‘Disgruntled community’ A centre meant to bring services closer to the people of Reeston. The facility will house services such as a library and host various sporting activities. However, disgruntled community members say there are far more urgent needs in the area. Disgruntled Community Member Luthando Mtya says, “This thing is not going to give us electricity they will just give offices to their friends and mark my words you will us here next week toy-toying complaining about this thing it’s not even finished.” Community member Nokuzola Yumata says, “We don’t have a clinic ambulances struggle enter our area because of the bad state of our roads.” Government believes this centre will serve a purpose to this community. It’s promised to look into the issues raised by disgruntled community members. Eastern Cape Human Settlements MEC, Nonceba Kontsiwe says, “We are going to look at the plans of the department for this financial year and put them in the plans because I’m not sure in terms of housing. There are any housing that is going to be built because l am not sure in terms of housing there are any houses that are going to be built; but because we don’t want to make any promises where we are not sure. We are just going to look at the plans broadly and accommodate them in future.” With the Local Government Elections coming in October, Reeston residents have vowed not to vote until they have seen an improvement in their living conditions.
