The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) is calling for the postponement of this year’s Local Government Election to May next year. The party however says it is against the extended postponement and amalgamation of the local government, provincial and national government elections until 2024. It says this will dilute campaigning as all the spheres of government are vastly different. The party’s spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa says postponing the election for a short period does not require constitutional amendment, but just a resolution in light of unprecedented circumstances created by COVID-19. He added this will also give enough opportunity for South Africa to be vaccinated and to attain herd immunity. EFF reiterates call for postponement The EFF has called for the postponement of the elections. Following a meeting of its top leadership in late March, the EFF indicated that the party will write a letter to the Electoral Commission asking that the date for elections scheduled for later this year be pushed back. Originally the party had proposed that local, provincial and national elections be merged and held in 2024. Now it says it simply wants a postponement. “If they don’t want to synchronise, at least they can postpone the elections. There was no political activity and you cannot have a free and fair election without an effective campaign,” says EFF leader, Julius Malema. Malema talks about the postponement:  Meanwhile, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has rejected the Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) proposal that the local government elections be rescheduled to coincide with the general elections in 2024.
