Former cabinet minister’s estranged wife, Nomachule Gigaba, will take the stand at the State Capture Inquiry on Monday after having summons issued against her. Gigaba withdrew her scheduled appearance before the Commission nearly two weeks ago, citing unhappiness with the conduct of the commission through her lawyers. Karyn Maughan weighs in on Gigaba’s withdrawal from state capture inquiry:  She is expected to shed light on her estranged husband’s relations with the controversial Gupta brothers. They are accused of having influenced some state decisions and securing backroom deals at state-owned companies, among other claims. Charges they deny. The Commission will also hear her husband Malusi Gigaba’s application to cross-examine her. Former Transnet Group CEO Siyabonga Gama will kick off proceedings at 10am. He will be testifying about his tenure at the rail agency. On Friday, the commission heard that former Transnet CFO Anoj Singh had 12 FNB accounts as well as accounts with Investec, Absa, Capitec, Standard bank and Nedbank. The commission heard that in one of the FNB accounts where Singh received his Transnet salary, he had accumulated R19 million over a period of three and half years. The commission heard that there were outflows of only R700 000 from the account throughout the three year period, raising questions about how Singh was funding his lifestyle during that time.
