Egyptian pharmaceutical firm Minapharm has agreed to produce more than 40 million doses a year of Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which markets the vaccine abroad, said on Thursday. The two parties agreed to begin technology transfer immediately, it said in a joint statement with Minapharm, and the roll out is expected in the third quarter of this year. “RDIF and Minapharm will initially supply over 40 million doses per year. Production will take place in Minapharm’s biotech facility in Cairo for global distribution,” the statement said. Egypt to purchase Sinopharm vaccine Earlier this week, Egypt agreed to purchase 20 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine produced by China’s Sinopharm and expects to receive a batch of 500 000 shots this month, its health ministry said. The agreement boosts vaccination efforts in Egypt, which has a population of 100 million and has so far received a total of just over 1.5 million doses of Sinopharm and of the AstraZeneca shot.
