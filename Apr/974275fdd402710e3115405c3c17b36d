Messages of condolences are continuing to pour in for former KwaZulu-Natal rugby player, Lindani Myeni, who was fatally shot by police in Honolulu in the US state of Hawaii. Twenty nine-year Myeni, who hails from Richards Bay in KwaZulu-Natal, was shot in a  confrontation with police after they responded to a burglary in progress. Police say that Myeni who lived nearby, allegedly followed a woman to her home and exhibited strange behaviour. They also say that when they arrived at the home, he charged at the officers. However, in a Facebook post, his widow Lindsay Myeni says her husband had gone out for a drive after a fun family day. She says he was only gone for 18 minutes when she received the news that her husband had been shot four times.

He will be sorely missed and we really pass on our condolences out to his family his wife and his two kids and obviously his family here in Durban. May his soul rest in peace,” says Hindley. Hindley’s full tribute to Myeni is in the video below:  The South African Government needs to demand answers from the US Government. The bodycam footage from the police is not convincing. Lindani was walking in the street when he was pointed out as a robber. 3 cops, one man. He was not a threat to them. #JusticeForLindaniMyeni pic.twitter.com/ydHX0Fje86 — Khanyi Magubane (@Khanyi_Magubane) April 17, 2021  The International Relations Department says it is aware of the fatal shooting and is waiting for the family’s families response before taking any further steps. “We as DIRCO have been alerted to the incident and through our mission in the US we have asked them to assist with their response and we are still awaiting their response,” says Dirco’s Lunga Ngqengelele. The Police only identified themselves to Lindani Myeni after shooting him. It could anybody asking him to get on the ground while pointing a torchlight in his face. He had a right to defend himself. How do you shoot someone & afterwards shout “Police”. #JusticeForLindaniMyeni — Man’s NOT Barry Roux  (@AdvoBarryRoux) April 17, 2021  #JusticeForLindaniMyeni
Police manage to bring in armed white guys who’ve just perpetrated mass shootings without a scratch on them all the time but can’t bring in an unarmed black guy into custody alive pic.twitter.com/FU8vAEAhXM — Demigod  (@Savage101_SA) April 17, 2021  A Black man is an Endangered Species in America #JusticeForLindaniMyeni pic.twitter.com/Dr7u83LPwc — ZAR 50 million (@realnorma_kay) April 17, 2021  Just learnt of the unfortunate sad news of our brother Linda Myenis passing in the hands of the Honolulu police.

RIP brother and condolences to the family. pic.twitter.com/ADxOZbywW7 — Sifiso Mtshali (@amahlemt) April 17, 2021  TRAINED and ARMED police always panic at the sight of unarmed black men, but somehow can arrest white terrorists without harming them. Then we have an issue of white women who have successfully weaponised their tears against black people for centuries. #JusticeForLindaniMyeni — IZWELETHU  (@miss_andisa) April 17, 2021  This past week alone has been a lot for South Africans wow #JusticeForLindaniMyeni #JusticeForLufuno #JusticeForLulu #RIPDrSindi #RIPNellie #RIPSpokgoane pic.twitter.com/YoSC5gKnLE — Poponosi (@Mphosssible) April 17, 2021
