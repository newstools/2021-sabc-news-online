Civic organisation, Sanco, in the Free State has reiterated its support for ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule despite his decision to step aside from his position. On Monday, the governing party’s highest decision-making body instructed all members who face criminal charges to step aside within 30 days or be suspended. Magashule and 14 others face corruption charges relating to an asbestos housing project in the Free State, while he was Premier. Sanco Chairperson Gift Poli says they are planning to galvanise support in the province against Magashule’s stepping aside. “We strongly believe that this step aside is designed to remove comrade Ace Magashule – that is why we are saying we will be going to our branches, talking to our people, going street by street and house by house, explaining what is the implication of the step aside. Comrade Magashule is elected by branches of the ANC, even if it is a personal choice but ultimately the branch must decide his fate,” says Poli.
