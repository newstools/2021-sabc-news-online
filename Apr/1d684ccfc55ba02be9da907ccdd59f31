Former President Jacob Zuma says he is ready to become what he describes as a “prisoner of the Constitutional Court”. Zuma has refused to say what he thinks an appropriate sentence would be for him should he be found guilty of contempt of court for violating an order of the Apex Court, which compelled him to appear before the commission investigating claims of state capture. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng had given the former president until yesterday to make his suggestion. Instead, Zuma wrote a 21-page letter in which he says he cannot assist the court in violating his rights. He also used the opportunity to slam the Apex Court for, what he calls, the abuse of judicial authority and engaging in politics. “My position in respect of the contempt of court proceedings is a conscientious objection to what I consider to be an extraordinary abuse of judicial authority to advance politically charged narratives of a politically but very powerful commercial and political interests through the Zondo Commission. My objection is legitimate, as it is sourced directly from the Constitution itself and what it promises,” says the former president. Below is his letter:  The state capture commission has asked the court to imprison Zuma for two years should it find him guilty of contempt.
