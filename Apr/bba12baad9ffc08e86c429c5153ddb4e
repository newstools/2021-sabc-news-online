KwaZulu-Natal police continue to monitor the situation at the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) in Umlazi south of Durban. This follows violent protests by students who are supporting staff in their demands for a salary increment. Provincial Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu is currently in a meeting with the university management and student representatives. Chairperson of the student representative committee, Sinalo Thengwa says they want the university to allow students who owe money to register. “One of the issues that made us to embark on a mass demonstration is the issue of financial exclusion. 9000 plus [students] at this point are not financially cleared at MUT because they are owing the institution.” “We are in the pandemic, our parents are retrenched, they are not working, we don’t have money to pay the institution. What we are fighting for is that the institution must financially clear us so that we can register. Mangosuthu [University] is having a population of 13 000 plus students, but at this point, only 2000 students managed to get registered. The majority of students are unregistered,” explains Thengwa.
