Anti-Apartheid activist and education expert, Graeme Bloch has been honoured for his lifelong commitment to the fight for justice and equality. His funeral service was held at the St. George’s Cathedral in Cape Town on Friday. Proceedings were also streamed online. Bloch passed away at the age of 65 in Cape Town last week. He was actively involved in the fight for liberation in the 80s and organised safe houses during the struggle. Family, friends and dignitaries gathered to pay their last respects to Bloch. Bloch died in hospital last week, after losing his battle to a brain disorder which he was diagnosed with seven years ago. He was the husband of former African National Congress deputy secretary-general Cheryl Carolus. Anti-Apartheid activist, Graeme Bloch laid to rest:  The struggle stalwart was described as a gentle giant, a revolutionary and a comrade. His brother, Lance Bloch gave a moving tribute to him. “Farwell Graeme, our beloved brother. With your body no longer broken and your soul no longer fettered, sing, fly and dance free into the universe. Go gentle into that goodnight with the love of a grateful nation and of your grieving family.” Bloch’s sister in law, Beth Daniel says he is at peace now. “Seeing Graeme the day with his passing on, I looked and I said, Thy will be done and Graeme was so peaceful, no pain, even a smile on his face, and that is how I remember Graeme.” Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says Bloch fought against the injustices of the apartheid. “Comrade Bloch grew up in the trenches of the anti-apartheid movement. At least he lived to see the fruits of his labour, the post-apartheid South Africa of which he played a part. He is indeed one of our national heroes and one of our greatest with the likes of the Sisulu’s, Tambo’s and Mandela’s.” Bloch will be remembered as a humble servant of the people. A private cremation took place after the service. RIP Graeme Bloch | Funeral service for the struggle activist
