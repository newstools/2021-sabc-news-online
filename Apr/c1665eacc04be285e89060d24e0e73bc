The Mpumalanga Department of Community Safety, Security And Liaison has advised motorists to exercise extreme caution while on the road. It is reported that at least 40 people lost their lives on the Mpumalanga roads during the Easter holidays. Departmental Spokesperson Motsi Moeti says many still travel at night during curfew hours. “We have already lost 4o live since the commencement of the Easter holidays. This worries us too much because we are on lockdown. Obviously, the curfew starts at 00:00. We would expect some reductions because people are not traveling after midnight. Last year, there was a hard lockdown. So, we only had 6 fatalities. We are encouraging our people to continue to use the road as cautiously as possible so that this number does not grow more than it is already is because we really need to save lives on our roads.” Crash in KZN Meanwhile, at least seven people have been killed in a collision between two vehicles on the R34 between Ulundi and Vryheid in northern KwaZulu-Natal.
