The Judicial Service Commission has concluded interviews for the position of the Free State Deputy Judge President. The candidate list included Judges Mafa Mbele, Johan Dauffe and Somangathi Naidoo. While two of the candidates are considered seasoned judges, Judge Mafa Mbele has the least experience and is the youngest candidate. The first in the hot seat was Judge Johan Dauffe, he is the only male candidate. He was grilled on his contribution to transformation during his tenure at the Bloemfontein bar and on the bench. Later on, it was Judge Mafa Mbele’s turn, one of the only two female candidates. With her five year’s experience as a judge, Mbele was previously employed by Legal Aid South Africa. She described herself as a visionary. She was mostly asked about her experiences leading those more senior than her in the legal profession. The first part of the interviews was concluded with Judge Somangathi Naidoo. He was quizzed on three reserved judgments that she had not listed in her application for the top job. Free State High Court Judge President Cagney Musi says, “You said you had no reserve judgements when instead you had 3 at the time of the filing.” Judge Soma Naidoo says “The judgement was ready and I had sent them electronic to a colleague.” Following the announcement of the recommended name for the position of deputy Judge President in the Free State, candidates from Limpopo were also interviewed for the role of deputy Judge President. Contending for the position were judges Phanuel Mudau, George Phatudi and Violet Semenya. Judicial Service Commission concludes interviews for Deputy Judge President:
