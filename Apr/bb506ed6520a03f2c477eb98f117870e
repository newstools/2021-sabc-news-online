LegalWise South Africa says investigations must be conducted by the Mbilwi Secondary School in Sibasa, Limpopo, to determine the action to be taken against learners involved in bullying. The Limpopo Department of Education has launched its own investigation into circumstances that led to the suicide of a grade 10 learner after the 15-year–old was assaulted by another learner. The incident was captured on video and circulated online. Head of Research at LegalWise SA George Pelser says: “So from a legal point of view, the schools are regulated by their code of conduct and by what the SA Schools Act says as well. There are certain procedures that the school must follow as well. The school must investigate this matter, get all the evidence in place, seeing what happened and deal with it in terms of the code of conduct, which will lead to a disciplinary hearing against the student being accused of bullying and which may lead to the suspension of the child from the school which is in line with the school’s code of conduct.” SABC News Reporter Pimani Baloyi gives more insight into the bullying incident:  Users on Twitter have shared their thoughts on the incident, with the #JusticeForLufuno:  She was trying to explain 
She didn’t fight back

This is a parents worst nightmare. It’s heartbreaking. I hope that the minister of basic education visits the school and the family while she is on her Limpopo oversight. No school in our nation should entertain bullying in any shape or form. pic.twitter.com/YAGBL3dTTq — Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) April 13, 2021  Before she gets arrested, Mbilwi Secondary School should EXPEL her. Yes , she has a right to education but not under an expense of being a danger  to other children. #JusticeForLufuno — ツ ØƦł ÐẸBłĠ BẸẠŦ$™ ❼ (@Ori_Debig_Beats) April 13, 2021  Dear parents, show/send the video to your kids, explain to them what bullying does and also what is bullying. Let them understand the impact it has on and what it says about them if they bullying. Taking videos and cheering is enabling the bully also. #JusticeForLufuno — Tannie (@nubian6) April 13, 2021
