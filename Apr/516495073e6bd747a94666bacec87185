A Gqeberha man, in the Eastern Cape, has been sentenced to three life sentences for three murders he committed in two separate shooting incidents. He was also sentenced to five years imprisonment for attempted murder, two 15-year sentences for the unlawful possession of a firearm and two three-year sentences for the illegal possession of ammunition. The sentences will run concurrently. Twenty-four-year-old Neaven Domingo committed the crimes in 2019 in Bethelsdorp. They are linked to the ongoing gang-related violence plaguing the area. Provincial Police Commissioner, Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga, lauded the collaboration between the investigating officers and the prosecuting authority, ensuring gangsters are removed from the communities in which they live and operate.
