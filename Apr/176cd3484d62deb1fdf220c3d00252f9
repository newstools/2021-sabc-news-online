ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule has described his meeting with former party president Jacob Zuma as very meaningful. Magashule travelled to Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday to seek advice from Zuma who is also accused of corruption. Magashule, who is on a mission to seek guidance from former party leaders, is among the party members that the NEC has instructed to step aside from their positions within 30 days or risk being suspended from the ANC. He met former ANC Treasurer General, Matthews Phosa, on Tuesday. Magashule and his co-accused face several charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering relating to the alleged irregular awarding of the more than R250 million Free State asbestos roofing audit contract. The alleged crime was committed during Magashule’s tenure as the Free State Premier. Meanwhile, his deputy, Jessie Duarte, has urged Magashule to dissociate with people who want to sow divisions in the governing party. While sympathetic to Magashule’s, the ANC deputy secretary general, however, warned that he can’t be responsible for the demise of the ANC. More on Duarte’s views in the video below:
