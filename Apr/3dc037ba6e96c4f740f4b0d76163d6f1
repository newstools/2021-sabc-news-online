The Ad Hoc Committee on Legislation Amending Section 25 of the Constitution to allow for expropriation of land without compensation has unanimously adopted its report. The report will be submitted to the National Assembly on May 21. It’s about the views of those who participated during public hearings on the expropriation of land without compensation that were held throughout the country. Committee Chairperson, Dr Mathole Motshekga, says the adoption of the report paves the way for the introduction of a bill on the expropriation of land without compensation. “Adoption of this report opens the gate for us now to go into real work because our real work is not the document itself…it is the bill because the official document which informs our debates on the draft bill. Now we must do the work that we will debate otherwise this process will be futile,” adds Motshekga.
