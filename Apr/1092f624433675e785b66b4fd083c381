Suspended Presidential Spokesperson, Khusela Diko, has vowed to appeal the Gauteng ANC Provincial Disciplinary Committee decision for her to step down as a member of the Provincial Executive Committee. The PDC has found Diko guilty of bringing the party into disrepute. It has also ordered Diko not to return to her work as the presidential spokesperson. Diko was suspended from her job in January for alleged failure to disclose all her financial interests. At the time, she was on special leave following the awarding of R25 million PPE contract to Royal Bhaca Company, the company that belonged to her now late husband, Chief Thandisizwe Diko. Seale to continue as acting spokesperson for the President pending probe on Diko:  The ANC Gauteng PDC says Diko brought the ANC into disrepute by failing to declare her husband’s businesses to the party’s Chairperson or Provincial secretary. Her lawyers Avela Nontso Attorneys say their client will petition the National Disciplinary Committee to seek a review of the PDC’s verdict. Diko believes the PDC erred in its judgement against her, as the charges hinged on baseless allegations. In a letter from her lawyers, Diko says the decision of the PDC did not quote, or rely on a rule, that placed a responsibility on a member of the ANC, to disclose a spouse’s business interests to the PEC or the Provincial Office Bearers. It further stated that ANC witnesses as well as the PDC itself, admitted that no such practice existed. Therefore, the ruling consisted of nothing more than their own beliefs and opinions about what “should” have been done in the circumstances. On the PEC’s decision that she steps down as a member of the highest decision-making structure in the province, until all SIU investigations are done, Diko says she is not being investigated by the SIU or the Hawks.
