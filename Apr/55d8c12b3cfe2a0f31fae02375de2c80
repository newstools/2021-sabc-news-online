Judgment in the bail application of Ntutuko Shoba, who is the alleged mastermind behind the murder of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule, will be handed down on Friday in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court. Shoba brought a second bid for bail today maintaining his innocence. He stated through his defense lawyer, Shaddy Sithole, that he will not interfere with any evidence should he be granted bail. Shoba maintains he did not have a hand in Pule’s murder. He has solely put the blame on Muzikayise Malephane, who pleaded guilty of murder, defeating the ends of justice as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. Malephane entered a plea bargain with the state naming Shoba as the mastermind. But Shoba maintains they only connected through alcohol sales during the hard lockdown. Shoba also submitted that he was a breadwinner and that his grandmother depended on him. However, he was fired from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange a few days ago. A decision, he says, he will be appealing. Ntuthuko Shoba in court for second bail application:
