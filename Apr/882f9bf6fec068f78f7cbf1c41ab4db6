Limpopo Connexion Company says it is targeting municipalities, private entities and households in its multi-million rand broadband connectivity project. The company, which is a subsidiary of the Limpopo Economic Development Agency (Leda), has rolled out broadband connectivity in the province. It says none of the government departments will be able to procure its services because the State Information and Technology Agency is the sole statutory supplier of broadband infrastructure and services to national and provincial departments. Leda’s spokesperson, Patrick Monkoe says they have already set up a number of facilities including a data centre and  52 internet sites to the value of  R500 million. “We are not prevented by any act in this country to connecting municipalities’ private schools, we can connect private clinics, we can connect households and businesses. The work involved, the building of the bigger offices, we have net operating centre. You have got the call centre and you also have the computer data, basically the substation of the main data centre that is sitting there at Peter Mokaba Stadium and other money obviously is to trench the road where we laid fibre.”
