A Cape Town healthcare worker, who spent seven weeks in hospital in a coma after contracting COVID-19, has been discharged. Jaco Versfeld is a senior administrative clerk at the Kraaifontein Community Health Centre. He first started experiencing COVID-19 symptoms late in January and tested positive, along with his wife Leona. Versfeld, who received oxygen support in hospital, has described his recovery as a miracle. He made it home in time to celebrate his 20th wedding anniversary with his wife. Provincial Health Department spokesperson Shimoney Regter has urged residents to choose responsible behaviour. “Western Cape Government Health thanks all who have contributed to Jaco’s recovery and who continue to fight the coronavirus. As we enter this long weekend we urge all residents to choose responsible behaviour. Remember to wear your mask, keep a distance of 1.5 metres from others, and stay home when you are sick.”
