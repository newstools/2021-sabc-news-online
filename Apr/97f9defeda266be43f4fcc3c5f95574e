The African National Congress’ (ANC) Fezile Dabi regional co-ordinator in the Free State, Reagan Booysens, says they have consulted all the ANC branches in the province in making sure that the party’s secretary-general, Ace Magashule, gets the maximum support that – Booysens says – he deserves. The region says it will interdict the ANC’s National Executive Committee’s (NEC) stance on the step aside resolution. This comes as the 30 day period during which Magashule must step aside fast runs out. Magashule is facing corruption charges among others. Addressing the media in Parys, Booysens said: “We are going to interdict that [step aside] thing, we just waiting for the due date and we are going to interdict that decision. Because we know the decisions we took at Nasrec and branches are talking about interdicting, because of the decisions they took in Nasrec. So they did not take a decision when a person is charged. We said when a person is reported or when there are allegations about the person,” explains Booysens. SABC News’ Samkele Maseko elaborates on this story:
