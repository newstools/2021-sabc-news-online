The alleged mastermind in the Tshegofatso Pule murder case has been fired from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. In a written statement on Friday, the JSE confirms that Ntuthuko Shoba is no longer an employee. Shoba worked in the company’s IT division. The company says it’s working with authorities and will continue to co-operate. Shoba had been on cautionary suspension since his arrest in February after Muzikayise Malephane confessed to Pule’s murder and turned state witness. Pule was murdered last year. Her body was found hanging from a tree in the west of Johannesburg. She was eight months pregnant at the time. Ntuthuko Shoba, alleged mastermind in Tshegofatso Pule murder, back in court:  Shoba is currently attempting his second bail bid, and is expected to return to the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court on Monday. During his appearance on Thursday, it emerged that Pule was allegedly on her second pregnancy. The revelations came as the state used cell-phone records in a bid to show that Shoba’s version of events were far from the truth and that he tried to kill Pule at least once before. In his affidavit, Shoba claimed he was a doting father, excited to meet his child. However, the state prosecutor says WhatsApp messages show a different side and that this was not their first child. Pule’s family was shocked by the news. Closing arguments in the matter will be made on Monday when the bail hearing resumes.
