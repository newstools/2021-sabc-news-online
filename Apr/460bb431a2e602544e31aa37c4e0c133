Limpopo Education MEC, Polly Boshielo, says education is going through a difficult period in the province.  She says after the highly publicised suicide of grade 10 Mbilwi learner, Lufuno Mavhunga, a number of incidents involving learners happened in the province. Boshielo was speaking at the funeral of four grade 11 learners at Jim Chavani High, outside Malamulele, who died in a car crash last Friday. She recalls other incidents involving learners in the past week. “That’s our job to give our learners hope that not everything is lost, and Minister I received a call that two learners died in an accident in Bochume, and Minister, by the way, there is one learner who is in hospital from George Hladi School. She was stabbed by another leaner just behind her ear. She is going through that operation and we just pray that she is well. The media does not say anything about them, I also received a call from the Mayor of Greater Giyani telling me that our grade 12 learner has committed suicide,” says the MEC. Yesterday, a 14-year-old minor who is accused of assaulting Lufuno Mavhunga appeared before Thohoyandou Children’s Court. The Grade 10 learner from Mbilwi High School faces an assault charge with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The bail application was conducted in-camera. The prosecution has opposed the release of the minor back into the community due to safety reasons. However, the defence is argued for the release of the learner into the care of her parents. The hearing was postponed to next week Wednesday and Thursday:
