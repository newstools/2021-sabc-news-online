The Gauteng Tourism Authority says there’s been an increase in the number of visitors to the province over the Easter weekend. It says township hotspots have also been abuzz. CEO Barba Gaoganediwe says most activities took place during the daytime with families out in numbers exploring the province. “We have seen a sharp increase in those taking day trips, vacations and those taking friends and families. Our lodges, game farms and nature reserves and heritage sites [had more visitors]. Township experiences recorded over 70% occupancy rate. This works well for the sector as we continue to use domestic tourism as a catalyst for economic recovery.” KZN sees an uptick in visitors Tourism authorities in KwaZulu-Natal say the industry is slowly picking up after being devastated by the strict lockdown restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The province welcomed more leisure visitors over this Easter weekend, compared to the previous year.
