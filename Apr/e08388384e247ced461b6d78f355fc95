The five men accused of killing the Coka brothers on a farm in Mpumalanga have been granted bail of R10 000 each. The bail hearing of Daniel Malan, Cornelius Greyling, Othard Klingberg, Michael Sternberg and Zenzele Yende was held in the Piet Retief Magistrate’s Court this morning. The court says the accused are not flight risks. Zenzele and Amos Coka were shot dead earlier this month in Mkhondo after an alleged altercation with the accused. The brothers had apparently been enquiring about why they were not re-hired to do seasonal farm work this year. Their family says it was financially dependent on the two brothers. The community and Coka family are unhappy over the court’s decision. The Cokas say they are now living in fear:  The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in the area has slammed the magistrate’s decision to grant the five accused bail as reckless. However, the party says it is comforted by the news that more charges could be added against the suspects.
