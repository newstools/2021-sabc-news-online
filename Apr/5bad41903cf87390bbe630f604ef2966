Southern African Development Community (SADC) security and defence ministers are expected to meet in Mozambique on Wednesday ahead of the planned Extraordinary Double Troika Summit. The gathering will discuss the instability and insurgency in Mozambique’s northern region of Cabo Delgado, where militants have been terrorising the region since 2017.

The international community has called for action to end the fighting in Cabo Delgado, with the United Nations (UN) on Tuesday welcoming an announcement by Mozambican authorities that the town of Palma had been cleared of ISIS linked militants and was once again secured.
