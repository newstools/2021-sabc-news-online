The trial of pastor Timothy Omotoso will resume in the High Court in Port Elizabeth after an adjournment last week. This was due to the non-availability of presiding judge, Irma Schoeman. Earlier, judge Schoeman heard four consecutive testimonies from witnesses, including former Idols contestants, Neliswa and Anele Mxakaza, with the latest being Wendy Mahola. The defence is expected to cross-examine Mahola today. The pastor and two co-accused, Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho face at least 90 sex-related charges, including rape, racketeering, human trafficking and sexual abuse. In February, the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein dismissed Omotoso’s application for leave to appeal a high court order, which denied him bail. Omotoso has been in custody since his arrest, more than four years ago. Below is a report on Omotoso’s previous bail application at a PE court:
