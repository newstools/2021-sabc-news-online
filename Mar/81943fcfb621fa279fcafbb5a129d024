Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says the province does not support a shift to Alert Level 2 lockdown restrictions over Easter. This as Premiers are expected to meet at the Presidential Co-ordinating Council later on Tuesday to discuss the matter. According to Winde, available data would not support the move, which he says would undermine plans for economic recovery. “We have always said we believe in data–based and evidence–based decision making and we have also had a consultative process over the last few days with the health sector specifically, but also the economic sector and the faith-based sector. The position of the Western Cape that I will be taking into that meeting is that the regulatory framework and the space that we find ourselves at the moment is adequate,” says Winde.

In his letter to the nation on Monday, President Cyril Ramaphosa says the matter is being deliberated on following a request by a number of religious organisations. He says while every effort must be made to support the right to religious freedom, this must not place the rights or the lives of others at risk. In light of the threat of a third wave of the coronavirus, Ramaphosa has encouraged religious communities to continue to innovate in the holding of congregational worship. Incoming COVID-19 Ministerial Advisory Committee Co-chairperson, Koleka Mlisana, has urged South Africans to abide by any restrictions that might be announced for the Easter long weekend:  – Additional reporting by Busi Chimombe
