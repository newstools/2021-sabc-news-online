Some in the religious sector have expressed disappointment in some of the announcements made by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday night. South Africa will remain under Level 1 of the COVID-19 lockdown regulations over the upcoming Easter holidays with adjusted restrictions. The sale of alcohol for offsite consumption will be prohibited from Easter Friday to Monday, while the curfew remains the same. Easter weekend church services will be allowed 250 people for indoor gatherings and 500 people outdoors. Bishop Setumo Dlothi of the God’s Will Faith Ministries says although they welcome the ban on the sale of alcohol, they would have liked 50 percent capacity in churches over Easter. Dlothi says, “This is part of what we have been praying for but what we had for was 50 percent across the board. All the religious leaders more especially for larger congregating churches they were anticipating that the President will allow 50 percent because let’s look at it from this way we look at the church like Rhema it’s over 5000 people and then you are only allowed to have 250 that is a little bit tricky and frustrating. It will affect the conferences because usually during this time people used to go to those places and you will have different speakers coming from different places we are indeed disappointed from the presentation of the President.
