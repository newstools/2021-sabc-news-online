Tensions are likely to run high at tertiary institutions on Tuesday as students vow to continue their protests in an effort to shut down institutions of higher learning. Several universities and colleges across the country had no lectures on Monday and at least one institution, the University of KwaZulu-Natal, has suspended lectures for the rest of the week. A student was shot and wounded and several others arrested during clashes between protesting students and police in Johannesburg:  Students countrywide are demanding that those who are in debt be allowed to register and that historical debt be cancelled. The shooting incident happened in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, during a protest by students from Wits University and the University of Johannesburg against the exclusion of students with historical debt. The police have, however, refuted reports that they had fired on the protesting students. In a statement released on Monday night, the police said they’ve taken note of a video and reports indicating that a female student was allegedly shot and wounded. They say none of their members deployed in Braamfontein had fired any shots during the protests, but that a smoke grenade was used in one incident and water cannons in others. The police denial comes hard on the heels of the arrest of four police officials by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate on Monday in connection with the death of Mthokozisi Ntumba.  The 35-year-old father of 3 was shot and killed last week when he was caught between the police and protesting Wits students. The four officers are expected to appear in court on Wednesday where they’ll be charged with murder and attempted murder.
