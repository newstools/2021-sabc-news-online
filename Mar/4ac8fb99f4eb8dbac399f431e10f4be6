The police have intensified a search for two 14-year-old boys who went missing in the Bohlokong township in Bethlehem in the Free State. They disappeared on Thursday after they went to a nearby bush to search for herbs. Provincial police spokesperson Motansi Makhele says the boys were with a friend who later reported the matter. “It is alleged the two boys, Sphiwe Mlangeni and Moratehi Radebe were together with another schoolboy of the same age and were walking together to the river next to the railway line not far from their homes to pick up herbs. On their way, the missing boys took another route and that was the last time he saw them. The police search team has been established to search for the missing children.” Radebe says a case of a missing person has been opened and is being investigated. “Anyone who has information about the missing boys can contact Captain Aaron Mbhele of Bethlehem detectives on 0823367760.”
