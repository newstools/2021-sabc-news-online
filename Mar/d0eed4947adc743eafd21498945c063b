This is coupled with an increase in international petroleum prices. In light of the current situation, the AA has called on government to intervene in stemming hefty fuel price increases as South Africans battle dire financial circumstances.

The direct and indirect knock-on effects cannot be ignored by government any longer and we believe urgent intervention is needed,” adds Beard.
