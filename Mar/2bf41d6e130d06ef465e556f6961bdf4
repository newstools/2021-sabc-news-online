People want to assist this commission to understand what happened in regards to the matters it is investigating. It is completely unacceptable that witnesses are targeted and attempts are made on their lives,” explains Zondo. The deputy chief justice also praised those who have appeared before the commission despite threats and attacks against them. “I applaud the courage of various people in our country who despite this to their own safety and their lives and to the safety and lives of their loved ones, nevertheless have come before this commission to assist the nation to understand what happened in regards to the matters that we are investigating. And I applaud those who will still come to the commission,” adds the deputy chief justice. The Hawks are investigating the weekend assassination attempt.
