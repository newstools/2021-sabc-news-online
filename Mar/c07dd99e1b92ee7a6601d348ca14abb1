Sport, Arts and Culture Minister, Nathi Mthethwa, says the death of legendary actor Menzi Ngubane is a great loss to the entertainment industry. Fifty-six-year-old Ngubane, who was best known for his role as Sibusiso Dlomo in SABC 1’s soapie Generations, died last week after losing his battle with diabetes and kidney failure. He recently played the character of Judas in the popular drama series Isibaya.  He was laid to rest at his home in Ladysmith in KwaZulu-Natal today along with his father Ndodeni Ngubane who died three days after Menzi’s passing. We honour Menzi Ngubane’s bravery. He stood by his principles, for which he was ready to make great sacrifices because he would never agree to be cowed into silence. In this way, he was a trailblazer, a pioneer & a patriot whose legacy will live on for many generations to come. pic.twitter.com/SqQUGBv78V — Min.

The Minister says artists should be afforded the support they need as some have been hard hit by COVID-19. “Their talent , their artistic ability is what make them to be people like any other people. So a mindset has to change in order for us to start taking the industry seriously; because it is an industry,  it’s not just something of entertaining; because even if you entertain  people as professionals you are supposed to be remunerated.” Legendary actor Menzi Ngubane laid to rest in Ladysmith:
