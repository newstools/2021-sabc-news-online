The State Capture Commission of Inquiry hears Transnet-related evidence from the former Transnet Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr. Brian Molefe. Earlier on Monday, Deputy Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo, expressed concern about the increase in attacks on key witnesses appearing or expected to appear before the State Capture Commission. His comments come in the wake of an assassination attempt on a key witness over the weekend.
