The Thaba Chweu Municipality has suspended its decision to cut off electricity supply to households that are in arrears in Mashishing, Mpumalanga, to avoid destabilising the area. This after residents of the area embarked on a violent protest last week. The residents who barricaded the main road leading to the township with stones and burning tyres, are accusing officials of the municipality of corruption, mismanagement and failing to deliver basic services. Municipal spokesperson Ezrom Sekgobela has called on all households that are in electricity arrears to contact their councillors to discuss their outstanding debts. He has encouraged the elderly and unemployed to apply for the indigent subsidy. Power cuts Meanwhile, Eskom says Stage Two load shedding will now continue until 05:00 on Wednesday. The power utility says Stage Two, which was meant to end on Sunday evening, had to be extended due to further loss of generation capacity and to allow it to replenish emergency generation reserves. In a statement, Eskom says: “Over the past two days, Eskom teams successfully returned a generation unit at the Matimba and Medupi power station. However, during the weekend we have suffered further breakdowns at five power stations, putting further strain on the generation capacity.” The power utility says it will assess and communicate as the situation changes as it works to return the units back to service. #PowerAlert1 Stage 2 loadshedding will be extended to 05:00 on Wednesday following the loss of further
