The Polokwane High Court in Limpopo has heard that an 18-year-old matriculant who was stabbed in Seshego last year died of wounds to vital organs such as kidneys. Thoriso Kgomo died in hospital a few days after being stabbed. Nineteen-year-old Dimakatso Mochemi who is on trial for Kgomo’s killing testified that he acted in self defence after Kgomo provoked him. Mochemi is conducting his own defence as his legal representatives have withdrawn. He was allegedly part of a gang that has been terrorising the community and he is known as “King Buda” amongst his peers. Mochemi is also on trial for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl in 2019.
