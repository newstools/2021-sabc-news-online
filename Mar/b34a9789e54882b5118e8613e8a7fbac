Mamelodi has experienced a spike in criminal activities such as car hijacking and business robberies. The community feels Gauteng Premier David Makhura does not take their situation seriously. Mamelodi Unite Chairperson Tsaka Tsepedi says they demand the provincial authorities to attend to their plight. “We are marching because most important issues like health facilities of Mamelodi are in poor conditions. Sports grounds are in poor condition. We need a museum and RDP houses because most of the RDP houses are occupied by foreign nationals. We ask ourselves how come we, South Africans, don’t have RDP houses.”
