A special COVID-19 vaccination program for Chinese citizens in Zimbabwe was implemented under the coordination between the Chinese Embassy and Zimbabwe’s health department on Saturday. Chinese citizens working and living in Zimbabwe can go to the Health Point Hospital in Harare, capital of Zimbabwe, to receive COVID-19 vaccination. Many Chinese people queued outside the Health Point Hospital on Saturday morning. Members of the 18th medical team aiding Zimbabwe came to the vaccination site to provide assistance for their Chinese compatriots. The Chinese Embassy noted that according to the national vaccination program of Zimbabwe, foreign citizens in the country who hold work or residence permits can go to the designated vaccination sites by themselves. However, the special vaccination program for Chinese citizens has been set up to serve those who are not currently eligible for Zimbabwe’s national vaccination program, with many hoping they can be inoculated at an earlier date. “We are very happy to hear the news because we have waited for the special vaccination program for a long time. We can feel the care of our government and the embassy for us overseas Chinese,” said Zhang Lijun, a Chinese citizen in Zimbabwe. “I felt no pain at all when receiving the vaccine because the medical staff have excellent skills. I feel excited and also quite relieved,” said Li Junyi, employee of a Chinese company in Zimbabwe. According to the Health Point Hospital, about 160 Chinese citizens came to get vaccinated on Saturday. President Mnangagwa launches second phase of Zimbabwe’s COVID-19 vaccination programme:
