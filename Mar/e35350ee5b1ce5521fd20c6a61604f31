Mabuza visited the pharmaceutical company, Biovac Insitute in Cape Town, to view the possibilities the facility holds in enabling South Africa to manufacture its own vaccines in the future. As Chairperson of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on COVID-19 Vaccines, Mabuza says more vaccines are scheduled to arrive in the country soon. More than 177 000 frontline healthcare workers have been inoculated as part of the Johnson & Johnson trial vaccines. The plan was to upscale the vaccination programme towards the end of March. However, Mabuza says a shortage in supply is a major hurdle. “No good news, we are still struggling with availability. Of course, J&J is picking up now and Pfizer will come into play so in the next few weeks we are expecting more vaccines. We thought by the end of March we would reach a million but it doesn’t look like it, probably the first week of April, the second week of April, that’s when we’re going to reach a million. But as we are speaking now inoculation is continuing, though not at a very good pace. I can say the pace is not good.”
