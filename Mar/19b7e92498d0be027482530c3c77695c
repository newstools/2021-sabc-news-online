Former CEO of Trillian Management Consulting, Bianca Goodson, has told the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg that she was told that Gupta associate and Trillian Capital shareholder Salim Essa had the necessary connections in government to open the cash taps. Goodson says this was the response she got from her recruiter at Trillian, Clive Angel, when she asked about how Trillian being a new and inexperienced company managed to secure a large Eskom contract. Goodson says she understood that Trillian would only be operational for the duration of former President Jacob Zuma’s tenure in office. The Commission heard that Trillian was appointed as a supplier development partner to work with McKinsey but was sidelined by McKinsey on the Eskom project. “And Mr Angel specifically said to me, you need people with relationships and our major shareholder. Mr Essa is one of the people with those relationships. His words to me exactly were ‘you need people to open the taps.’ It’s the phrasing that he used, ‘and our shareholder can open the taps.'” Below, former Trillian CEO Bianca Goodson testifies:
