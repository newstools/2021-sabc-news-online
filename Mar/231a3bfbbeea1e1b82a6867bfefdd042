The South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF) has called on the police to immediately cease the surveillance of journalists. It says it will address the issue with Police Minister Bheki Cele and President Cyril Ramaphosa. In the latest incident, the house of an investigative journalist from the Daily Maverick was broken into and her two work laptops stolen. The journalist was reporting on documents that were submitted by former Crime Intelligence head Peter Jacobs in court papers. The file video below from 2018 discusses the impact of surveillance on journalists: a SANEF Media Freedom Chair Mary Papayya has condemned the threats, intimidation and the bugging of investigative journalists by the police’s Crime Intelligence Division. “We strongly condemn the threats and intimidation of investigative journalists by the unit. It takes us back to a very dark history of our past. This is unacceptable. This is the second journalist. Another journalist from Media24 also received numerous reports from police sources that he was under surveillance from the Crime Intelligence. We will write to Police Minister Bheki Cele and President Ramaphosa to request that those responsible be dealt with,” says Papayya.
