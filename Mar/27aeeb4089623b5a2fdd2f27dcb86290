Former President Jacob Zuma has missed the deadline to file answering affidavits to the Constitutional Court in his contempt of court case. Zuma was given until the end of Monday to respond to the application by the State Capture Commission asking the Constitutional Court for a two–year imprisonment order against him. The Commission took Zuma to court for violating a court order compelling him to testify before it. The application also cited the Police Commissioner Khehla Sithole and the Police Minister Bheki Cele as respondents in the case. The application will be heard by the Constitutional Court on the 25th of this month. In January, the Constitutional Court has ruled that former President Jacob Zuma must appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The Commission had lodged an urgent application to force Zuma to appear before it and respond to allegations levelled against him by more than 30 witnesses. The court has also declared that Zuma cannot invoke his right to remain silent as he had initially threatened. Zuma has been ordered to pay the Commission’s legal costs and those of the two counsels.
