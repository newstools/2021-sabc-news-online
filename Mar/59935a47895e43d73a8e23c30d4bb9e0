The sister of King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, Princess Thembi, has paid tribute to her late brother, describing him as a King of peace and calm. Princess Thembi and her brother, Prince Mbonisi, addressed journalists on Sunday afternoon at KwaKhethomthandayo Royal Palace in Nongoma for the first time since the King’s passing. Princess Thembi says that King Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu was a peacemaker. “We know that during this time of the lockdown, we need to make sure that we adhere to all regulations as set out by the government. We thank you very much. The late King was a very calm person who always stood for peace.” Brother to King Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, Prince Mbonisi Zulu, says while the family is devastated by the King’s passing, they are comforted by the support they are receiving from all South Africans. “Although there is dark cloud upon us in KwaZulu-Natal, we find peace seeing unity displayed by the King subjects. If we all continue working together, the King’s spirit will go well and be well received by our forefathers after the King executed well his duties leading our nation.” The Zulu Royal Family briefs the media about King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulus plans for the mourning week:  The address concluded a day filled with visits from several high profile political leaders who had come to pay their last respects. The AmaZulu monarch passed away on Friday from COVID-19 complications in a Durban hospital. Preparations continue for his planting (a term used for laying kings to rest) on Wednesday evening. The ceremony will be attended by men only:  A memorial service will be held on Thursday. The Zulu Royal Family has urged people the services live on TV and other media due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The SABC will carry the services live on its platforms.
