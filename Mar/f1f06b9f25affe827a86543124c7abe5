Inkosi Melizwe Dlamini of the Nhlangwini Tribal Authority in Highflats in southern KwaZulu-Natal has passed away. This has been confirmed by traditional prime minister to the Zulu monarch and nation, Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Dlamini, who was 52 years old, had been sick for some time after having suffered a stroke, according to his family. “We are very…I can’t explain it. As I’m standing here, I can’t even control myself but we are trying very hard to contain ourselves. But Melizwe Dlamini was everything to us. Even the way he led his people was exemplary,” says family spokesperson, Sipho Dlamini. Induna uBongani Jaca adds: “As the Nhlangwini community, we are very saddened by the passing of iNkosi. He was very helpful to us. He always had good advice for us. He was a chief that loved development so the news hit us really bad.” Inkosi Melizwe Dlamini’s grandmother princess Mpiyamaxheku Dlamini was King Dinuzulu’s daughter. He made headlines, receiving backlash from Zulu traditionalists, after he lodged an application with the Nhlapho Commission – which was established in 2004 – for his chieftaincy to be elevated to that of a king. The commission was set up to look into traditional leadership disputes and claims. Dlamini was one of 11 chiefs in KwaZulu-Natal who claimed kingdomship at the time. – Report by Bongani Gema
