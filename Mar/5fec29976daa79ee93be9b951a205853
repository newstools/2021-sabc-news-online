United States (US) Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday congratulated Tanzania’s new President Samia Suluhu Hassan, the first woman to hold that office, and said the US was ready to strengthen ties between the two countries. Harris, the first woman and first person of color to serve as US Vice President, made the comment in a posting on Twitter. “Sending best wishes to @SuluhuSamia following her swearing in as Tanzania’s new President – the first woman to hold the office. The United States stands ready to work with you to strengthen relations between our countries,” she wrote. Hassan, who had been Vice President since 2015, on Friday urged the country to unite and avoid pointing fingers after the death of John Magufuli, her COVID-19 sceptic predecessor.
