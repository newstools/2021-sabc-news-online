As the COVID-19 pandemic enters its second year, government and leaders must step up to help minimise the emotional and physical strain of South Africa’s already struggling youth. This is according to Deputy Minister in the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities Hlengiwe Mkhize. The spokesperson for the department, Amanda Tshemese, says these are some of the issues that have been prioritised with the launch of the National Youth Policy 2030 on Friday that will focus on a decade of accelerating positive youth development. Tshemese says young people with disabilities remain among the most vulnerable of our society. “Unemployment rates are typically higher for young women. Also, youth in rural areas face different challenges from those in urban areas. In most cases, they are vulnerable and exposed to multiple challenges based on age, social status, education and health. The girl child faces double disadvantages because of gender discrimination at a household and community level.” South Africa has an unemployment rate of 32.5% :  The objectives of the policy include among others integrating youth development into the mainstream of policies, programmes and the national budget, promoting positive youth development outcomes in addressing the needs of young people and building their assets and supporting young people, particularly those outside the social, political and economic mainstream.
