Stellenbosch University is inviting interested parties to comment on the first draft of its revised language policy. University spokesperson, Martin Viljoen, says the 2016 language policy is being revised as part of the five-year revision plan as set out in the strategic document. The policy changed the primary language of instruction at the university to English from Afrikaans. It, nonetheless, did make provision for students who prefer Afrikaans as a medium of instruction. Court rules on the official medium of instruction at Stellenbosch University:  Viljoen says the policy stipulates that it lapses five years after the date of implementation. The current policy was implemented at the beginning of 2017. “The first public participation period starts on 20 March and closes on 12 April 2021. A second public participation process is planned for later this year. Comments related to the first draft of the revised policy can only be submitted via a digital platform available on the SU language webpage,” says Viljoen while explaining the deadlines for the first draft. The University made headlines recently when students alleged that house committees didn’t allow them to speak Afrikaans in their residences. The institution found the incident to have been limited to one residence, saying it was due to the misinterpretation of the language policy. The University of Stellenbosch has said through its language policy, it wants to promote multilingualism and equitable access to the institution.
