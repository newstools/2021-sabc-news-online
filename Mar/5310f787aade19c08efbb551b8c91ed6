A 17-year-old boy is expected to appear in the Ventersdorp Children’s Court in the North West on Monday in connection with the murder of 27-year-old Mapula Khune – the sister of Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper, Itumeleng Khune. Her body was found at her family home in Extension 2 near Ventersdorp on Thursday morning. It’s believed that the backroom in which the deceased was sleeping was burnt. Police spokesperson, Adele Myburg, says when emergency services arrived at the scene, they found Khune’s body severely burnt. Myburg says the teenage suspect was charged on Friday afternoon for the murder. “It’s alleged that on Thursday, the 4th of March at about 5 am, neighbours saw smoke coming from a house in extension 2, Tshing. Emergency services were called – who after forcing entry into the backroom – discovered the severely burnt Khune on top of a bed,” says the police spokesperson. It is not yet clear how the teenager is related to Khune nor why is he thought to be the one behind the murder. Itu Khune out due to family bereavement. Khune has lost his beloved sister on Thursday morning. We send our deepest heartfelt condolences to Itu and his family. The Club will give Itu the necessary support in this moment of grieving. May her soul Rest In Peace.#Amakhosi4Life pic.twitter.com/H902ndUEBR — Kaizer Chiefs (@KaizerChiefs) March 5, 2021
