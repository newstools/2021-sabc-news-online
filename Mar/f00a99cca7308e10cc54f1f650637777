Police are clearing up after students from the University of Johannesburg (UJ) blockaded several roads with burning tyres around the SABC in Auckland Park, Johannesburg. Last week, scores of students from Wits University, as well as UJ, took to the streets to protest against the non-registration of students who have outstanding debt. The South African Students Congress (Sasco) and the Economic Freedom Fighters Student Command have also threatened to shut down all institutions of higher learning on Monday. In the video below, SABC News’ Hasina Gori is reporting from outside UJ:      Wits University says it will be open and operational on Monday, despite calls from student groups for a national shutdown of all tertiary education institutions. Wits spokesperson Shirona Patel says university management has met and will join the vice-chancellors of other public universities to address the demands underlying the spate of student protests that swept the country last week. Patel says management met with students on Friday to engage on their concerns. “Some of the major demands included the postponement of the academic year to the 30th of March, that all students be allowed to register and graduate irrespective of the debt they owe the University, that there be no increases for 2021 and that all students who have been given residence offers be allowed to occupy residences immediately. Another demand was that all suspension orders be uplifted with immediate effect,” she says.
