Stanley Itshegetseng, from the office of the MMC for Environment and Infrastructure Services in the City of Johannesburg, says Eskom must give the electricity supply service to City Power because it has failed to deal with the Johannesburg community’s power interruption challenges. He says on numerous occasions they have tried to engage the power utility on damaged electricity transformers in the city, but they have been getting poor response. Residents of Zola in Soweto are currently protesting to demand the restoration of power to their area after being without electricity for months. Eskom has blamed this on the overloading of the system due to illegal electricity connections. City Power dismantles illegal electricity connections in Ennerdale:  Itshegetseng says a number of areas in Soweto, Orange Farm, and Doornkop have been without electricity for months due to damaged transformers. “We are of the view that they must give us back the service. Even when people go to attack a councillor, the councillor does not provide electricity. The councillor takes their views and submit them to Eskom. “Sometimes they have a meeting with Eskom who makes promises and never keep them. I communicate with Eskom, they never honour any agreement we make with them. But going to the house of a councillor in protest is wrong they must go to Eskom,” explains Itshegetseng.
