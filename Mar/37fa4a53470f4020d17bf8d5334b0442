Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and party MP Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi are back at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday morning for their assault case. The two are accused of assaulting a police officer at the funeral of struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in 2018, in an incident that was caught on closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Malema and Ndlozi allegedly pushed Colonel Johannes Venter after he tried to deny them access to the cemetery, saying they were not accredited to enter. The pair pleaded not guilty to the charge, and have not taken the stand to give their version of events. Drama Last year, the court proceedings were marred by a lot of drama, including the banning of the media from streaming the event live after a cellphone of one of the camera operators rung during court proceedings. State witness, Police Colonel Johannes Venter, took to the stand and detailed how he was assaulted by Ndlozi and Malema at Madikizela-Mandela’s funeral. However, Malema and Ndlozi’s defence team told the court that Venter’s evidence was contradictory. The CCTV footage of the incident showing the alleged assault of Venter by Malema and Ndlozi was played at the Randburg Magistrate’s Court. Employed at the Presidential Protection Unit, Venter told the court that both Ndlozi and Malema pushed him as he tried to explain that they can’t enter the cemetery using a vehicle, but only by foot.
