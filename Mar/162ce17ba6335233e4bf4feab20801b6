[WARNING: STORY CONTAINS GRAPHIC CONTENT] Deputy Minister in the Presidency responsible for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Hlengiwe Mkhize has expressed shock about the alleged rape of a 34-year-old woman in a hospital in Flagstaff, Eastern Cape. It is alleged that a male nurse raped the woman while she was in a consultation room with him. Departmental spokesperson, Amanda Tshemese says it’s worrisome that cases of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and femicide in the province are increasing. “It is very clear that there is a huge problem in the Eastern Cape when it comes to Gender-Based Violence and femicide. Recently, a 12-year-old was raped in Port Elizabeth. The department takes such cases very seriously as the country is fighting against GBV. We are very worried about these cases. Deputy Minister Mkhize wants to reassure the nation that the department is working very hard in ensuring that South Africa becomes a GBV-free country.” Police spokesperson Tembinkosi Kinana says they are investigating a case of rape. “The reports suggest that a 34-year-old woman was bringing a child for medical treatment when she was lured to the hospital consulting room where the incident took place. The matter was then reported to the authorities and subsequently, a case of rape was opened for investigation. The 31-year-old suspect who is believed to be a male nurse was arrested and charged. He appeared in the Flagstaff Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday and was granted bail.”
