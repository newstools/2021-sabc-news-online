The African National Congress (ANC) in Johannesburg wants criminal action instituted against former City of Johannesburg manager Dr Ndivhoniswani Lukhwareni. The party has accused Lukhwareni, who severed ties with the city on Tuesday, of maladministration and improper conduct during tenure under the Herman Mashaba mayorship of Joburg. The city said in its statement that it was a mutual termination of employment. The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Joburg believes Lukhwareni is being made a scapegoat for the alleged COVID-19 related corruption within the city. Gauteng COGTA MEC Lebogang Maile asked Joburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo to explain the terms and conditions of this “mutual termination of employment” between the city and Lukhwareni. Maile’s spokesperson Castro Ngobese says, “In his letter MEC Maile wrote: It will also be appreciated if the initial contract of employment entered into between the City and the former City Manager, as well as any settlement agreement entered into between the parties that provides for the “mutual termination of employment”, be presented to me as well. The City’s response must, amongst others, clearly spell out the reasons that led to the said mutual termination.”
