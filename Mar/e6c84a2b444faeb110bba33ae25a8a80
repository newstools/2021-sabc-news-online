ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule says the governing party’s National Working Committee has directed the government to find the money and resources to address student grievances over financial exclusions at tertiary institutions. He was speaking to over 100 Wits University students who marched to the ANC’s headquarters, Luthuli House, in Johannesburg on Thursday. Magashule says free education is ANC policy and that those who say otherwise are not ANC members. Magashule says it’s not right that Unisa can’t take in extra students at the university this year. He also condemned the fatal shooting of Mthokozisi Ntumba, allegedly by police, saying that the police can’t operate as it did under Apartheid. Ntumba was reportedly shot dead by police who had been roped in to disperse protesting students on Wednesday. Police minister says justice needs to happen in Ntumba’s shooting:  Earlier, the protesters went to the Johannesburg Central police station to protest against police brutality. They have also handed over a memorandum to the Constitutional Court, calling on the Apex Court to start being involved on student matters.
