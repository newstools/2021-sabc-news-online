Police management in the Western Cape says it will intensify efforts to deal with illegal firearms. This follows the fatal shooting of two police officers in Kraaifontein on Sunday and a number of other fatal shootings in Mitchells Plain in the past few days. Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa says they’ve activated a 72-hour action plan in an effort to catch the suspects. With the Western Cape having recorded a concerning number of murders and attempted murders in the Cape Town metropole from Thursday until Sunday, the police have intensified efforts to tackle illegal firearms through targeted operations. In the past week, 30 firearms and ammunition were seized in various operations executed by the police throughout the province. Meanwhile, Police Minister Bheki Cele says the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces are hostile to the police. He made the remark while speaking at the funeral of a constable who was shot dead while attending to a gender-violence complaint in the Durban Metro. Police are under attack, says Minister Cele:

Constable Mfihloyakhe Royal Ndlovu’s funeral service was held in the KwaXimba area, west of Durban. It coincided with the killing of two police officers while on duty, in Cape Town.
