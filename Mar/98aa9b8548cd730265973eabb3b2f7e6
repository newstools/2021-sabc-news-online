President Cyril Ramaphosa has condemned the killing of 35-year-old Mthokozisi Ntumba who was shot during yesterday’s protests by Wits University students in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. President Ramaphosa was speaking before the National House of Traditional Leaders. He described the events during the protests as deeply disturbing and said the country was mourning Ntumba’s tragic death. Mthokozisi Ntumba’s family speaks following his killing:  Two student journalists were also shot and wounded and have been admitted to the Milpark Hospital. Police Minister Bheki Cele has labelled the police action that led to Ntumba’s death as inexcusable. Cele met the 35-year-old’s family in Kempton Park, in Ekurhuleni, this morning. Cele says that he can’t give answers to what really happened and that the only explanation he can offer is that someone went crazy. Ntumba was a married father of three children who had just obtained his Master’s Degree. He was employed by the Department of Human Settlements. “He’s got a young wife. I think his youngest son is just a year old. It’s a sad issue. It’s a sad situation to look at. It’s something that you can’t really even be able to live with as a human being now, taking all other elements of life out,” Cele told journalists after meeting the Ntumba family. Ntumba, who was leaving a clinic in Braamfontein when tragedy struck on Wednesday, died on the scene from bullet wounds. His visibly aggrieved family didn’t want to talk to the media. – Additional reporting by Pearl Magubane
