Social media messages around sardines being netted in Durban have been dismissed as fake news. That’s according to a fishing enthusiast, Adam Kamdar. Pictures have been circulating on multiple networks this weekend alleging sardine sightings at uShaka beach in Durban. But, Kamdar says it’s still too early in the season for the popular sardine run. “When I saw those photos, to me it looked liked sardine bait that a fisherman had discarded and just took a picture. It’s probably just a bit of tongue in cheek or a bit of fun that these guys are sharing these pictures. It doesn’t look like the start of the sardine run, but earlier this week I did see photos from further south where sardines did beach but this is also not part of the sardine phenomenon, this is a small pallet shoal where the trawlers normally go and net sardines, the shoal came close to shore. Probably chased by game fish that brought them to shore. But it’s still early in the season and we hoping to have a bumper season this year.  But I don’t think it started just yet.”
