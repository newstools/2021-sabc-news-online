Opposition Members of Parliament have lamented the lack of action against those who are found guilty of corruption in the public sector. They were debating the effects of corruption in the public sector, submitted by UDM leader, Bantu Holomisa. Holomisa says the country has shown over several administrations that there is no appetite to prosecute those guilty of corruption in the public sector. “Various cabinets over years have failed people, oaths of office broken, powers of accounting officers were and are usurped and political directives have been at order of the day since 1994,” he says. EFF MP Veronica Mente and DA MP Solly Malatsi listed recent corruption scandals. “A string of corruption cases while nurses and doctors died because of no PPE; all because money was looted. The truth of the matter is South Africans are sick and tired of discussing. You name the corruption scandal, ANC ministers involved, but we don’t see any prosecutions,” says Malatsi. The leader of the ACDP Kenneth Meshoe and Freedom Front Plus MP Ignatius Groenewald both say corruption continues to affect the most vulnerable. “Frontline workers have died because of no proper equipment, while money was looted, we don’t need another commission, we need action and prosecutions. Who suffers? The poor that don’t have access to services, poor services, recently a teacher died because of an accident caused by a pothole,” Meshoe says.
