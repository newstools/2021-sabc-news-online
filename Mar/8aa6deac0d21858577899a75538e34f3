A 30-year-old man has been arrested for the murder of his 53-year-old mother at Luganda outside Durban, in KwaZulu-Natal. Ncamisile Zondi’s body was discovered in a pit toilet in the area by community members in December last year. Provincial police spokesperson, Thembeka Mbhele, says the suspect left home shortly before Christmas and was arrested this weekend. “According to the neighbours, they stated that the deceased was living with her long lost son who returned about six months before the deceased died. Furthermore, it was discovered that the deceased had received her stokvel payouts. And on Saturday, the Mariannhill detectives received information that the suspect was at Luganda, hence they proceeded to the area and the suspect was eventually arrested,” says Mbhele. The suspect is scheduled to appear before the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court tomorrow.
