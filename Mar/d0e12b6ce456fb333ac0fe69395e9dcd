Calls from some political parties in the opposition benches are mounting for Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to step down before an impeachment by the National Assembly. The remarks come as the National Assembly is yet to decide whether to remove Mkhwebane or not. Independent panel finds prima facie evidence for Mkhwebane’s removal:  Congress of the People (COPE) spokesperson Dennis Bloem says Mkhwebane should save herself the embarrassment of being the first Public Protector to be axed before her term ended. “Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane must resign to spare herself the embarrassment of being fired. We welcome the report of the independent review panel that recommends that prima facie evidence exists for the Public Protector to be removed from office. COPE never voted in Parliament for Mkhwebane to be the public Protector. “ The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Parliament says it is not threatened by comments reportedly made by the African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General Ace Magashule that all ruling party members of Parliament should not vote with the opposition in the matter. DA Chief Whip in Parliament Natasha Mazzone says Magashule should understand that the country comes first before any internal party politics. “The Democratic Alliance has noted comments by the SG of the ANC Mr. Ace Magashule. I think Mr. Ace Magashule would do well to remember that he is not the president of the ANC as much as he wishes he was. There is a process that is in place and certainly there are no comments or threats that are made by the SG in our local Sunday Times that would put us off in our ultimate goal, which is to make sure that South Africa is put first before party ideological differences. “
