Eskom has announced that load shedding will be reduced to Stage 1 from Wednesday morning and will continue until Saturday 5am as the power system is still severely constrained. It says four generation units at Kusile, Grootvlei, Kriel, and Matla were successfully returned to the network since Monday, as well as the Cahora Bassa line from Mozambique. According to the power utility, this is not sufficient to suspend load shedding at this point, as generation capacity was lost at the Medupi, Arnot, and Komati power stations during this period. #POWERALERT1 Loadshedding will be reduced to Stage 1 from 05:00 on Wednesday and continue until 05:00 on Saturday as the power system is still severely constrained pic.twitter.com/V0LSjqKHDd — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) March 16, 2021  Addressing the media yesterday, Eskom’s Chief Operations Officer Jan Oberholzer said that South Africa will have to contend with load shedding until at least September this year. Oberholzer said that Eskom faces the uncertainty of about 6 000 megawatts of capacity at any given time and that the electricity supply would remain volatile until the maintenance plan is completed later this year. “The unreliability of the aging fleet with an uncertainty of about 6 000 MW of capacity at any given time, will remain until the reliability maintenance programme is able to address the historical maintenance backlog,” he said.
