The State Capture Commission of Inquiry continues hearing Eskom-related evidence from former Eskom Acting Group Chief Executive Officer, Matshela Koko. Earlier, Koko wanted to know whether President Cyril Ramaphosa has been issued with a rule 3.3 notice by the commission, as he says he had mentioned that Ramaphosa interfered in Eskom matters when he was deputy president.
