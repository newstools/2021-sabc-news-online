Cape Town Stadium is activating a plan to become financially independent from the City. A major business lounge with membership packages has been on the cards for some time, but it was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic. There’s hope that a return to stadium events with spectators could be around the corner. Cape Town Stadium CEO Lesley De Reuck says they lost millions during the hard lockdown. “When the hard lockdown call came, we lost to the value of R18 million in events. So, we needed to cover that through finding savings and cutting certain things off which we were luckily able to do.  The whole sporting industry, event industry, everyone is going through a seriously tough time at the moment. That’s why we’re pleading that we need to start having a serious discussion about allowing people back into stadiums.” Packages Membership to a business lounge is up for sale. The year–long hospitality package includes exclusive access to 2 100 prime seats of the stadium and a premium hospitality space. The packages include a Western Province Rugby season ticket. While it will become the host of professional rugby, it will not be an exclusive rugby stadium. Premier league soccer matches, major concerts and other events will continue to be hosted. It is hoped that major events with spectators will be allowed towards the second half of the year. De Reuck says, “Our frustration is that we can’t switch it on, because we don’t have people in the stadium, but we want to drive this to a break-even point where we are not needing any of the city’s funding and we can start funding our own operations ourselves.” The business lounge will be divided into three parts to cater for different needs. One each for hardcore sports fans, business networking and family-friendly space. Packages will cost between R8 000 and R15 000.
