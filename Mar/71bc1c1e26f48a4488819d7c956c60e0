Former Chair of the Correctional Services Portfolio Committee Vincent Smith and former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi are expected back in the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court, east of Johannesburg, in connection with their fraud case. Smith stands accused of accepting gratifications from Bosasa in the form of security upgrades to his home and cash to his company Euroblitz. This in exchange for shielding Bosasa from scrutiny for allegedly corrupting Correctional Department officials to enable the company to win billions of rand in contracts. He was allegedly paid at least R670 000 by Bosasa over three years and accepted security installations at his home valued at R200 000. Smith’s fraud charge also emanates from his failure to disclose to the Registrar of Parliamentary members the benefits he received from Bosasa. Vincent Smith granted R30 000 bail:  Smith appeared at the Palmridge Magistrate’s Court, after handing himself over at the Alberton police station east of Johannesburg, last year. This followed evidence presented at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry around his relationship with African Global Operations, formerly known as Bosasa.
