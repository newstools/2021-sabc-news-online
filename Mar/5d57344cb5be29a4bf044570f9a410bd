President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on ordinary South Africans to participate in the consultation process that is currently under way around the National Implementation Framework (NIF) towards the professionalisation of the Public Service. In his weekly letter, Ramaphosa says the framework, which Cabinet approved last year, aims to build a state that is insulated from undue political interference and where appointments are made on merit. This comes as government and public service unions are at odds regarding the reduction of the public service wage bill. President Ramaphosa says public servants must be able to continue doing their jobs “regardless of any changes within the governing party in charge of the administration, or changes to political parties after elections. Discussion on the professionalisation of public service with Professor Somadoda Fikeni:  Ramaphosa says the draft framework puts emphasis on the need to hold public servants accountable for irregularities and to do away with a culture of impunity in the mismanagement and misappropriation of state resources. He says it also suggests a more rigorous approach towards recruitment and selection of public servants, induction and performance management. The draft framework is available on the National School of Government’s website.
