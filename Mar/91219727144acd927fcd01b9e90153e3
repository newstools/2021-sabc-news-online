City of Cape Town authorities are monitoring a protest by University of Cape Town (UCT) students. Traffic Chief, Richard Coleman, says a group of about 50 people is protesting on Main and Anzio roads, heading towards UCT to meet up with other students. The protest forms part of countrywide student protests against financial exclusion which has led to the death of civilian, Mthokozisi Ntumba, at Wits in Johannesburg. Coleman says no roads have been closed as yet. About 200 students are protesting on the middle campus at the university. Meanwhile, protesting Wits students will on Friday launch an urgent court application to ensure that free, quality and decolonised education is realised this year.  The ANC says its Top Six Officials will meet with Higher Education Minister Dr. Blade Nzimande to discuss challenges facing students at institutions of higher learning. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says they have decided to intervene decisively and help address the problems confronting poor students. “The ANC is painfully aware of challenges that confront students in our institutions of higher learning regarding funding and is determined to act decisively in finding a long-lasting sustainable solution. In the light of the latest developments, the National Working Committee held on Wednesday directed the relevant subcommittee on Education and health to convene urgently to consider and advise on possible options.” He adds: “In addition, the National Officials of the ANC will today, Friday the 12th March 2021, meet with Higher Education Minister, Comrade Blade Nzimande, to discuss current developments. The ANC NWC is of the firm view that budget priorities should be reviewed in order to redirect the much-needed funding for the provision of necessary support in these institutions of higher learning.”
