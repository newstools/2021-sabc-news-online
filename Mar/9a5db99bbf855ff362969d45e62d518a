CEO of Business Unity South Africa and the former Managing Director of the Banking Association, Cas Coovadia, has described the passing of Peter Matlare as a tragic loss at a time when his leadership is most needed. The 61-year-old Matlare passed away on Sunday due to COVID19-related complications. Matlare has held several senior positions in the corporate world. He served as CEO of the SABC and Tiger Brands and at the time of his passing was serving as Deputy CEO of the Absa Group. As government seeks to recuperate a desperately ailing economy amidst battling the coronavirus pandemic, Coovadia says people such as Matlare would have led the fight for economic recovery. “It is indeed a tragic and sad loss very passionate about organised business and the role of business in society in promoting economic growth and prosperity in the country at a time.  We need skilled individuals to actually ensure that we out ourselves onto a sustainable economic growth path. COVID has been a severe constraint on economic growth and social growth besides the human cost and people like peter, would have been at the forefront of getting the economy to be repositioned to actually start growth again.” BUSA CEO Cas Coovadia pays tribute to Peter Matlare:  Meanwhile, Peter Matlare’s relatives have described the late Deputy CEO of Absa as a pillar of strength around whom the family connected. “Family was a cornerstone of Peter’s life. He used his talent and passion for cooking to regularly gather the family for Sunday lunches, and maintain deep connections in the family.  His support for family, friends and colleagues has left a lasting legacy,” his family says in a statement confirming his passing.
