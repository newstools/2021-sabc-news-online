The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has defended its former National Chairperson, Advocate Dali Mpofu for his utterances at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. On Thursday during cross-examination, Mpofu told Minister Pravin Gordhan’s legal counsel Michelle Le Roux to “shut up” along with Gordhan. To what was seen as disrespectful by many for Advocate Mpofu actions, but his party says there’s nothing untoward. EFF Treasurer General Omphile Maotwe says the EFF supports Mpofu following developments at the commission. Earlier on Friday, the Chairperson of the Commission, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, reprimanded Advocate Mpofu for his conduct. “No legal practitioner including Mr. Mpofu has the right to begin to tell any other person in this commission to shut up. That power belongs to the chairperson of the commission and even I will not use the words ‘shut up’. That conduct is unacceptable to this commission and it is important that the public and other legal practitioners should know that this conduct is not acceptable,” the Deputy Chief Justice said. Deputy Chief Justice slates Advocate Dali Mpofu over shut up outburst:  EFF calls for one election The party is having its three-day Central Command Council meeting in Boksburg from Friday. The party maintains its stance, calling for the postponement of the local government elections to 2024. Maotwe says there should be one national, provincial and local government election in the country. “We maintain that the elections must be postponed so that we can have one national, provincial and local government elections in the country because it’s too expensive for South Africans.” The EFF has congratulated the newly elected president of Tanzania, Samia Suluhu Hassan.
