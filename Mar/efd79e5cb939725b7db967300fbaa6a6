Leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Julius Malema will visit the family of the slain Mthokozisi Ntumba tomorrow, who was allegedly shot and killed by the South African Police in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. The 35-year-old Mthokozisi Ntumba  was killed during a protest by Wits University students in Braamfontein. It is alleged that Ntumba had just visited a local clinic when police allegedly shot him dead. Two student journalists were also shot and wounded and have been admitted to the Milpark Hospital. Cele visited the home of Ntumba On the Thursday Police Minister Bheki Cele spoke to the media after visiting Ntumba’s family home in Kempton Park east of Johannesburg. “He’s a young man. I saw his photo. He was working for the Department of Human Settlements and has just gained his Master’s degree. He’s a father of three, he’s got a young wife. I think his youngest son is just a year old. It’s a sad issue.” “It’s a sad situation to look at. It’s something that you can’t really even be able to live with as a human being now, taking all other elements of life out,” says Cele. In the video below, Police Minister Bheki Cele says there is no explanation for the killing of Mthokozisi Ntumba:  Wits sends condolences to the family of Ntumba Meanwhile, Wits vice-chancellor Zeblon Vilakazi has sent his condolences to Ntumba’s family. In a virtual address, Vilakazi described the incident as unfortunate. “I was obviously disheartened at the level of escalation that played itself out in the Braamfontein CBD with the sad loss of a bystander who lost his life yesterday [Wednesday] in that situation. I think my condolences go to the bereaved and I look forward to having a discussion with the Student Representative Council (SRC) on how we can arrive at a solution and de-escalate the problem,” adds Vilakazi.
