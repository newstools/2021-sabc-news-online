National Police Commissioner, General Khehla Sitole, has promised the Orange Farm community in the south of Johannesburg that their pleas for more police visibility in the area will be considered. The area is riddled with high incidents of murder and rape. In September 2020, the bodies of 6-year-old Simphiwe Mncina and 8-year-old Mpho Makondo were discovered meters apart in Orange Farm Extension 4. Their murders prompted a community protest and a march to the local police station calling for the resignation of the station commander. Details on the case in the video below:  Sitole and the police top brass are visiting Orange farm as part of a community safety engagement. He has vowed to respond to the community’s concerns in three months’ time. “We want to listen to the community inputs. What is it that we want to change and do it the other way round and do it better. How can we enhance the safety of the community of this particular area. But this Imbizo or this gathering does not end here today, we will be gathering these inputs and take them to the response plan,” explains Sitole.
