Former African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has told the State Capture Commission that estimates by Bosasa’s former chief operations officer (CEO) Angelo Agrizzi and company employee Richard Le Roux of the cost of camera installations on his properties are contradictory and suspicious. Agrizzi and Le Roux earlier testified that the cost of the work at Manthashe’s two Eastern Cape properties came to R600 000 and R300 000 respectively. In the video below, Mantashe responds to questions during the State Capture Inquiry:  However, Mantashe says he cannot dispute this as he was not invoiced for the work that was done in 2016. He says Bosasa director and family friend Papa Leshabane, who bore the cost of the installations, estimated the cost at around R50 000. “I had no dealings with Le Roux nor did I have dealings with Agrizzi. I had dealings with Leshabane. So if there were any statements to be sent, I assume that Le Roux would send them to Leshabane and Leshebane said to us I will install these cameras at my cost.” “I would assume that the statements and invoices will [be sent] to Leshabane. So I cannot dispute anything. All I am saying [is] a dispute between Le Roux and Agrizzi that almost doubled the cost looks suspicious,” explains Mantashe.
