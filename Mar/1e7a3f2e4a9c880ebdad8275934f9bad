Late ABSA Group Deputy CEO Peter Matlare has been described as a consummate professional and a family man at his funeral service in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Matlare died of COVID-19-related complications on Sunday. Matlare was a former CEO of the SABC and chief strategy and business development officer of Vodacom. Speaking at the funeral service, Matlare’s sister Lerato Pelatse says her brother was a leader and a pillar of strength in the family. Matlare’s daughter Itumeleng says her father was a larger-than-life character. “Speaking about my dad in the past tense is truly an out-of-body experience. I keep waiting for him to burst into the room warning everybody here that this child can talk from here to Gaborone and back none stop…” “My dad was a larger-than-life character who emanated warmth, love and understanding. The baseline of everything he did was honesty, integrity and respect,” says Itumeleng. The video below is Peter Matlare’s funeral service:
