African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa’s remarks at the end of the party’s National Executive Committee weekend meeting have been postponed indefinitely. Reports say this is due to the meeting’s heated discussions on the fate of ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule following the recommendations of the party’s integrity commission. #ANCNEC Closing remarks by the @MYANC President  @CyrilRamaphosa have been postponed. There is a tense discussion on all leaders charged to step aside within seven days. Some are arguing against such a move. #sabcnews — #TheLordOfTheMedia (@samkelemaseko) March 28, 2021  The watershed NEC meeting was expected to take a final decision on whether ANC members and leaders facing charges in court should step aside from their positions pending the finalisation of their matters. Those who are pro- Magashule are against such a move. Magashule and 15 co-accused are facing 74 charges of fraud, theft, corruption, money laundering – linked to the Free State asbestos saga. He is due back in court in August for a pre-trial hearing. Integrity Commission report below:  ANC NEC Meeting discussion The NEC meeting will use the opportunity to encourage party members to co-operate with the state capture commission as President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to appear before it next month. The party is likely to discuss the ongoing tug of war between its former leader Jacob Zuma and the Zondo Commission. Meanwhile, the ANC will also reflect on its relations with its alliance partners the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party, after a series of bilateral meetings with them last week.
