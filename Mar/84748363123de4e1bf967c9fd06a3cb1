Public participation in the process to rename William Nicol Drive in northern Johannesburg after struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, will begin on Monday and run until Freedom Day on April 27th. City of Johannesburg Mayor Geoffrey Makhubo has called on residents and others to take part in the renaming process and make their voices heard. Makhubo says the renaming is a result of the council’s commitment to social transformation and cohesion. “Well they look at if it’s not offensive to anyone it’s not vulgar it’s acceptable. It represents what the communities seek to achieve, well the views will be brought back to the full sitting of the council and then the council will debate and then a final decision will be taken. If there are what we call weighting which might mean, that no this name is not appropriate, something that basically the whole world can frown upon because of what they represent then, of course, we must come and debate that in council.”
