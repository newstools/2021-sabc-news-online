The number of people treated in French intensive care units (ICUs) for COVID-19 reached a 14-1/2-week-high on Monday, at 3 849, while total hospitalisations for the disease increased for the second day running, to 25 195. The number of people in ICUs is still almost two times lower than the 7 184 peak recorded in April 2020 but remains well above a government target level of 2 500-3 000 for easing coronavirus limits on the circulation of people. Illustrating the stress on the French health system, medical authorities of the greater Paris region – which accounts for roughly one-sixth of the French population – have ordered hospitals to cancel 40% of their planned normal activity to make space for COVID-19 patients in critical condition. French health authorities also reported 5 327 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours on Monday, a high for a Monday since December 21, versus 21 825 on Sunday. COVID-19 case reporting on Mondays typically dips as fewer tests are done over the weekend. The seven-day moving average, which smooths out daily reporting swings, stands at 21 270, a five-day high. The total of cases since the outbreak of the disease more than a year ago is now over 3.91 million, the sixth-highest in the world. An additional 359 people died from the disease, pushing the total to 88 933, the world’s seventh-highest toll. On Sunday, 130 new deaths were reported.
