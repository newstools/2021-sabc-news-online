Two suspects have been subpoenaed to appear in a Gauteng court on charges of fraud and theft amounting to over R2 million, later this month. The pair are accused of creating false invoices and inflating prices for services while working for an electronic company in Boksburg in Gauteng’s Eastrand between 2014 and 2015. They are expected to appear in the Palm Ridge Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on March 24, 2021. Hawks Spokesperson, Ndivhuwo Mulamu says, “We served two suspects with notice to appear in court on the 24th of March on allegations of fraud and theft involving a R 2.5 million theft from an electronic company in Boksburg where they worked as electricians…” “Allegations are that they created false invoices and inflated the prices of the services which were not even rendered, transferring money into their bank accounts. There are more suspects sought in this matter and investigations continue,” added Mulamu.
