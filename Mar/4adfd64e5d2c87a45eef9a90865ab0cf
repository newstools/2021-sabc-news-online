Businessman Tokyo Sexwale says what is happening in Mozambique is a rebellion by the country’s people against poor living conditions. ISIS militants say their fighters carried out an attack on the northern Mozambique town of Palma, where dozens of people including one South African were killed. Thousands were displaced and some are missing. The town is adjacent to gas projects worth about R900 billion, with a three-pronged attack on Wednesday last week. Fighting continued on Monday this week, according to a security source directly involved in efforts to secure the town. In the video below, International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor weighs in, Sikwani Ncube analyses the situation:  The government confirmed on Sunday that dozens of people had died, including seven when their convoy of cars was ambushed during an escape attempt. ISIS says at least 55 people were killed and buildings including factories and banks taken and destroyed and vehicles seized. Those killed included a number of soldiers. Sexwale, who has interests in Mozambique, says, “Our own workers there are in touch, people are dying. They have information on the ground about how weapons are being accumulated, the movement of some of these groupings. These are not just people from Timbuktu or some other place. They are from Mozambique. These are people reacting to the conditions that are there,” explains Sexwale.
