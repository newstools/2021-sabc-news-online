A 17-year-old boy arrested in connection with the murder of the sister of Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper, Itumeleng Khune, has been released due to insufficient evidence. The boy was expected to appear before the Ventersdorp Children’s Court on Monday morning. North West NPA spokesperson Henry Mamothane says, “What transpired today [on Monday] is that after going through the docket, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) realised that there is no sufficient evidence for us to institute a prosecution. So the docket has been send back to the police for further investigations. The suspect will be led free.” Mapula Khune’s body was found at her family home in extension 2 near Ventersdorp last Thursday. The backroom in which the 27-year-old was sleeping is said to have been burnt. However, authorities are yet to explain why the teenager was a suspect in the matter nor his connection to the deceased.
