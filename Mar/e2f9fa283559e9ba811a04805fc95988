The alleged mastermind behind the murder of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule is expected to apply for bail on Monday in the Roodepoort Magistrates’ Court, west of Johannesburg. Police arrested Nthutuko Shoba at his home in Florida late last month, after the man convicted of the murder, Muzikayise Malephane, entered into a plea agreement with the state to testify against him. Tshegofatso Pule’s family feels justice is being served:  Pule’s body was found in an open veld in Roodepoort in June 2020. She was eight months pregnant at the time. At his previous appearance, Shoba was formally charged with the murder, conspiracy to commit murder as well as defeating the ends of justice. Malephane told the court that Shoba promised to pay him R70 000 to kill Pule, so that his wife wouldn’t find out that she was pregnant. Malephane has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.
