France’s health regulator said on Friday it had approved Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine for use in France, a day after it was approved by the European Union authorities. “The COVID-19 Janssen vaccine can be used on people from the age of 18 … within the framework of the French vaccination strategy, including for people aged 65 and older and who might have illnesses,” the Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS) said in a statement. HAS said the vaccine was efficient and well tolerated by patients. It will be the fourth vaccine on the French market. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the Johnson & Johnson vaccine on Thursday, paving the way for the first shots to be delivered in a month.
