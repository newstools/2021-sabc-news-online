Eskom has cancelled Stage 2 load shedding with effect from Friday midday. It says this is because some of its generation units have returned to service. This has helped the power utility to restore its generation capacity to meet demand. In a statement, the power utility says their teams have successfully managed to return generation unit at the Duvha, Medupi, Kendal, Kriel and Kusile power stations. Eskom says it’ll use the long weekend to conduct short-term maintenance and replenish emergency reserves. “Although we have lost other units at Tutuka, Camden and Hendrina Power Stations, we have managed to adequately replenish emergency generation reserves. Eskom will also be taking the opportunity over the long weekend, due to the lower demand, to conduct short-term maintenance and to further replenish the emergency reserves in preparation for the week ahead.” The power utility has thanked South Africans for the inconvenience caused by load shedding and has also encouraged citizens to continue using electricity sparingly. Eskom Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha on concerns about the power utility:  ‘SA should bear with load shedding’ On Wednesday, Deputy President David Mabuza said South Africans should bear with the load shedding the country is experiencing, as Eskom tries to put measures in place to maintain its aging power plants. Asked by an MP what he would advise consumers to do to deal with load shedding, Mabuza said more effort should be put into reducing the period of load shedding. “We are now doing reliability maintenance so that these power stations can be reliable. We are going to do everything to shorten the period. Let’s accept what leadership has said. But we will go to say let’s put more effort to reduce the period of load shedding.”
