Zimbabwe’s second Vice President, Kembo Mohadi, has described the sexual misconduct allegations against him as a campaign to discredit him. After mounting pressure from the public, advocacy groups, and social media Mohadi has left office. In his resignation letter – he insists that the allegations are “flames of lies which are muddling his reality of his family life”. He says this was sponsored political sabotage. Mohadi says his resignation will also allow him space and time to seek legal remedy to clear his name. Earlier this year, three audio recordings of Mohadi made the rounds on social media. He was allegedly soliciting sexual favours from different women. In the recordings, a man can be heard scheduling to have sex at his office. The man is allegedly Mohadi. The women on the other end of the line are believed to be subordinates of working in his office. The 71-year-old has thanked the nation for their support during his tenure.
