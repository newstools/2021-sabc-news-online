The Mamelodi community, marching for lack of services in their township, says election campaign will never happen in their area as they feel neglected. They are marching to the HM Pitje Stadium to raise awareness about the deteriorating state of the township and its infrastructure. The marchers were expecting officials from Gauteng Premier David Makhura’s office to receive their memorandum, but no one showed up. A visibly angry Mamelodi United chairperson Tsaka Tsepedi says no politicians will be allowed to campaign in Mamelodi this year. “So what is left now it’s a no-go area now for Mamelodi. It’s all he needs. We don’t recognise him. No councillor of ANC will talk to us or tells us something. We have changed things now. We turn things around. If you are not born in Mamelodi you will never lead in Mamelodi. If push comes to shove one will regret very harshly.” SABC’s Molemo-waone Mothoa reporting from Mamelodi:  The community feels Gauteng Premier David Makhura does not take their situation seriously.
