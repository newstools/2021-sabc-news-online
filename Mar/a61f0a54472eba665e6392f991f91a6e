Former Transnet Group Chief Executive Officer Siyabonga Gama is scheduled to testify at the Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State Capture in Johannesburg on Thursday. On Wednesday, former Transnet CEO Brian Molefe denied taking bags of money from the Gupta residence despite allegations from two witnesses who said they saw him carrying money in a bag. He told the commission he did not have a clear recollection about one of his drivers questioning him about bundles of notes he had seen inside his bag. In the video below, the State Capture Commission continues to hear Transnet-related evidence:  The witness alleged that Molefe normally carried a brown leather bag when he entered the Gupta residence in Saxonwold and if he did not have the bag, he would re-appear with a sports bag. “Molefe asked me to fetch his cellular phone from his bag in his office, as instructed when I went to his office and opened the light brown leather back-pack to take out his phone, I was surprised his bag was more than half full with bundles of two hundred rand notes,” says the former driver. Evidence leader Advocate Anton Myburgh asked: “What do you say to that?” Molefe: “I have no recollection of that incident and I just wonder if he [the driver] did write it in his incident report, but I have no recollection of that incident.” Meanwhile, former Transnet Chief Financial Officer Anoj Singh and former Public Enterprises Minister Malusi Gigaba are also expected to testify.
