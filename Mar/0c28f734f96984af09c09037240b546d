Protests have flared up on the N2 in the vicinity of Chesterville in Durban. This has forced police to close the N2 north and southbound between the M7 and Spaghetti Junction with protestors throwing stones at vehicles. Durban Metro police spokesperson Parbhoo Sewpersad says it is believed that the protests are service delivery related. He says police are monitoring the situation. “Motorists are urged to stay away from the Spaghetti Junction and Chesterville areas and use alternate routes. There’s a large contingent of Metro police which have been deployed to the location at the moment.” Meanwhile, three foreign nationals have been arrested while four nightclubs issued with compliance notices and fines following inspections in the Durban CBD at the weekend. The visits monitor compliance with lockdown regulations by businesses, liquor traders and gambling outlets. Other departments like the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Labour were also involved. Spokesperson for the Department of Economic Development, Bheki Mbanjwa, says compliance notices and fines were issued to four nightclubs for contravening the lockdown regulations and the Disaster Management Act. “Some of these places continued to trade in contravention of the Disaster Management Act because under the current lockdown regulations, nightclubs are not supposed to be opened. Because this was a multi-pronged inspection, which also involved officials from immigration services and the liquor authority and gaming and betting board, we also arrested three people who are suspected of being illegal foreign nationals (and) one of those is a nightclub owner. Further to that, there were compliance notices and a fine issues to about four nightclubs for trading in contravention of the Disaster Management Act.”
