Today marks the official day for the observation of the 2021 Earth Hour. Candide gardening is using this window as an opportunity to bring awareness to the negative effects that artificial light at night has on our nocturnal pollinators. Earth Hour takes place at 8pm, a time when millions of citizens around the world switch off their lights to honour the annual environmental campaign that highlights the effects of climate change. Dr Sandy-Lynne Steenhuizen says artificial light at night is any light in the house, business, or town that could be affecting pollinators, insects,and animals that are active at night in gardens and nature around us. She adds that artificial light at night is a driver for the decline in pollinators. Dr Sandy-Lynne Steenhuizen shares more:  Meanwhile, A group of eco-warriors are dedicating part of their weekend to cleaning up the Durban Harbour in commemoration of Earth Hour. University of KwaZulu-Natal student Doctor Refilwe Mofokeng is driving the clean-up that will focus on picking up plastic waste in and around the harbour precinct.  – Additional reporting Minoshni Pillay
