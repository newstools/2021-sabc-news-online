Executive Mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay Metro Nqaba Bhanga, has called for the reversal of the new name given to Port Elizabeth. Bhanga says he is engaging with his legal team on the matter and the way forward. He recently wrote to Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa over the renaming of Port Elizabeth to Gqeberha. He says while he is not opposed to name changes in the process of reflecting the country’s history, the new names should portray an inclusive society, saying the chosen name has no connection to the people of the metro. Bhanga says, “The name Gqeberha has no meaning in isiXhosa; the name’s origin is in the Khoi language. Writing a Khoi word in isiXhosa distorts the whole reasoning of restoring the dignity of the Khoisan. The majority of people in this part of town are Xhosa speaking.” “The municipality long expressed its views that it will prefer this city to be named Mandela City, we still have 20 days to respond to this name. I’m consulting with my legal team and also people involved in names, in languages to guide us in this,” added Bhanga. Mayor requests a reversal of the new name for Port Elizabeth   I am opposed to the name changes of Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage. I have written to the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Mr Nathi Mthethwa, to express my concern – not only with the process that was followed to change these names but also the outcome thereof. — Mayor Nqaba Bhanga (@nbhanga) March 1, 2021  I am of the opinion these new names are not inclusive and, in fact, have no isiXhosa meaning. While not disputing the need for geographical names that portray an inclusive country, I believe that these names have no relation to and/or connection to the people of our Metro. — Mayor Nqaba Bhanga (@nbhanga) March 1, 2021
