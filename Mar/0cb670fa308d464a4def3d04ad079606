Two suspected ATM bombers, Sicelo Gibixhegu and Neo Madiba have been remanded in custody by the Moretele Magistrateâ€™s Court in Tembisa, east of Johannesburg. This after being arrested in an incident in Dikebu village, Bedwang, last week Friday. Community members who heard a commotion and shots being fired called the police. The two men who were allegedly attempting to bomb the ATM were later arrested while a bystander was shot in the stomach. The suspects are expected to go back to court for a possible bail application next week Wednesday.
