Meanwhile, spokesperson of the Zulu Royal family, Prince Thulani Zulu, says they closely guard the details around the burial. “The body will be fetched and will come to Kwakhetha I can end there. Because the burial of a person like the King is the secret of the family. It’s quite private. This thing of COVID-19 is not today’s thing.” “It started long ago because we can’t run away from the prescribed restriction of the COVID-19 regulations. People will be watching television and will see what is happening. We are sorry that we all want to be here but we can’t due to COVID-19,” says Zulu.
