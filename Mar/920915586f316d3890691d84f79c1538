Among Gumede’s co-accused are eThekwini municipal manager Sipho Nzuza and a number of business people. The charges emanate from a 2017 Durban Solid Waste tender of over R400-million. Earlier, scores of supporters, some as far as from the Free State, arrived outside the court ahead of her appearance. A group coming from ANC’s Fezile Dabi region says they believe in Gumede’s innocence. Outside the court, a marquee and a stage were set up where Gumede was expected to address her supporters after her appearance, as seen in the tweet below:  #sabcnews #sabckzn Outside the Durban Magistrate court, some of Zandile Gumede’s supporters have started arriving.
