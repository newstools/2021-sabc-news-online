The man killed during the students’ protest in Johannesburg last week, Mthokozisi Ntumba, will be laid to rest in Bergville in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. He was shot dead during a stand-off between police and protesting Wits students at Braamfontein. Four police officers have been charged for his murder. On Wednesday, during his memorial service in Pretoria, Ntumba’s colleagues remembered him as an upright professional with integrity. A recent Masters’s graduate and Town Planner at the City of Tshwane metro municipality, Ntumba was involved in the development of communities. His supervisor, Francois Swanepoel, says he has lost a key person in the process of formalising communities. “Mtho was a problem solver and self-motivated, a hard worker, dedicated to the task at hand. He was humble, diligent and willing to learn from the faults and mistakes of others such as myself. He had such a brilliant future ahead of him and will be missed. He was my wingman …,” Swanepoel said. Ntumba’s brother, Sanele Ntumba, says it’s hard to imagine life without him while Human Settlements group head in the City of Tshwane, Nonto Memela, says she hopes Ntumba’s death will not be in vain. Watertight case The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says they believe they have a watertight case against four police officers arrested for Ntumba’s death. Tshepiso Kekana (27), Motseothata Boitumelo (43), Madimeja Lekgodi (37) and Victor Mohammed (51) appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. They are facing charges of murder, three of attempted murder and defeating the ends of justice. They will remain behind bars until their next court appearance next week Wednesday, where they are expected to apply for bail. The state intends to oppose the accused’s request. A handful of students protested outside the court on Wednesday and urged the magistrate to deny the officers bail.
