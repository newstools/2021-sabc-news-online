A female student has been admitted to hospital after she was shot and wounded in the leg allegedly by police firing live ammunition during protests that have intensified in Johannesburg. Several students have also been arrested. A handful of students have gathered outside the Hillbrow Police Station in Johannesburg to demand the release of those who were arrested during clashes between protesting students and the police. The students are clad in different student structure regalia and are from different political parties. They are chanting and dancing in front of the police station and are vowing to continue until their comrades are released. Chriselda Lewis elaborates on this story in the video below:  The students from Wits and the University of Johannesburg were continuing their protests against the exclusion of students with historical debt at the time of the incident. The renewed protest is part of a nationwide call from the student union, SAUS, and student organisation, Sasco, for a shutdown of all the countryâ€™s tertiary institutions over financial exclusion. Last Wednesday, Mthokozisi Ntumba was shot dead during the Wits protest when police fired rubber bullets at students. The 35-year-old was coming out of a clinic when tragedy struck. Four police officers have been arrested in connection with his murder and are due in court on Wednesday.
