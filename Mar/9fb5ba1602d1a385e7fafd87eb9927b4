The State Capture Commission of Inquiry continues hearing Eskom-related testimony on Wednesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, chairperson of the commission, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said President Cyril Ramaphosa at this stage is not compelled to respond to allegations made about him by former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe in his testimony to the commission. Zondo’s comments come after the commission’s evidence leader advocate Pule Seleka indicated that Ramaphosa had received a rule 3.3 notice which is used to inform an individual who has been implicated in a witness’s testimony at the commission.
