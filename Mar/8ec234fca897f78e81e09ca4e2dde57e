The University of Fort Hare and the Walter Sisulu University (WSU) have each received R10 million from the Eastern Cape government to assist financially struggling students. This is part of the R30 million the provincial government pledged to its four universities. The Nelson Mandela University and Rhodes University each received R5 million. The Premier of the Eastern Cape, Lubabalo Mabuyane, says they are now looking at TVET colleges. Mabuyane says education is a societal matter and a catalyst for development in a province that is in need of critical skills. “If you look at our development trajectory, the oceans economy, agriculture and agro-processing to diversify from manufacturing and especially the auto sector. But even the auto sector needs more skills, those TVETs must come on board and provide skills. “It’s about impact. We are increasing our skills base in the province. We believe if we have a budget on the skills development, that budget must reach out what the national govt aims to do, to ensure there is stability in our universities.”
