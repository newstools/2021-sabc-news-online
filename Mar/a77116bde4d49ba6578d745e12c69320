Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema will visit the Zulu Royal Palace in Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal, on Tuesday to offer condolences to the royal family and Zulu nation. This follows the passing of Isilo Samabandla uKing Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu. The 72-year-old AmaZulu monarch bowed out in a Durban hospital in the early hours of Friday from COVID-19 complications. Malema will be accompanied by members of the EFF’s War Council. Malema says King Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu’s passing does not only affect the AmaZulu nation, but the whole country because the King fought for the rights of all South Africans. “We will be going there to Nongoma to also pay our respects. And to say to the Zulu people we thank the king for being at the Centre of peace in KwaZulu-Natal. Such a person is worth celebrating.” Malema was addressing the media after he visited the Ntumba family in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni. The EFF went to pay respects to the late Mthokozisi Ntumba who was killed after being struck by a rubber bullet fired by police during the Wits University student protests in Johannesburg.
