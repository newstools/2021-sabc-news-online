Boulders Shopping Centre Management in Johannesburg has come under fire after a controversial video has emerged on social media, in which the Centre Manager is seen verbally attacking a man clad in traditional attire, accusing him of wearing in an “indecent” manner in a public place. The incident took place in the Clicks store in Midrand, on Wednesday afternoon. According to a customer who was in the store, who would only speak on condition of anonymity, the Centre Manager, known as Jose Maponyane, confronted a customer, Thando Mahlangu, who was clad in his Ndebele attire, accusing him of dressing in an appropriate manner. Maponyane can be heard in the video saying he would not condone the outfit at “in my mall.” “Let’s cut the long story short, we’ve got a right of admission. I don’t condone this in my mall. So, ngicela uphume (please leave),” Mapoya can be heard saying. Mahlangu was quick to remind Maponyane that his attire was African in Africa, to which Maponyane insisted that the attire was “not descend” in a public space.
