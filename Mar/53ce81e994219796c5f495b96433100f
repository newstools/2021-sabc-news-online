The funeral service of Peter Matlare will be live-streamed from 07:30am on Wednesday morning. The 61-year-old deputy CEO of Absa died from COVID-19 related complications on Sunday. Matlare was also former CEO of the SABC, the CEO of Tiger Brands and a senior group executive at Vodacom. Matlare joined Absa Group Limited Board as an Independent Non-Executive Director in 2011. In August 2016, he was appointed Group Deputy Chief Executive Officer, as well as Chief Executive responsible for Absa Regional Operations. The family has described the late Matlare as a pillar of strength around whom the family connected. “Family was a cornerstone of Peter’s life. He used his talent and passion for cooking to regularly gather the family for Sunday lunches, and maintain deep connections in the family.  His support for family, friends and colleagues has left a lasting legacy,” his family said in a statement. In a statement released after the news of his passing, the Absa Group said Matlare made a significant contribution to the company, hailing him as an inspiration, a good leader who was passionate about his work. Matlare was at the helm of the public service broadcaster from January 2001 until January 2005, a period which saw the Corporation turn over positive profit results. In a statement, SABC Board Chairperson, Bongumusa Makhathini stated that Matlare’s legacy at the SABC was felt for years following his departure, and the organisation will continue to learn from the lessons and foundation he left behind. Makhathini says Matlare will forever be remembered for being a remarkable business executive, whose tenure at the SABC and subsequent companies he led, has left a blueprint on how to run successful businesses.
