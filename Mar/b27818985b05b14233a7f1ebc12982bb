The Wits University Student Representative Council (SRC) has threatened to continue protesting at the Braamfontein campus in Johannesburg on Friday against students being excluded because of fees. The SRC disrupted in-person registrations on campus after negotiations with Wits management deadlocked. The SRC says it’s fighting for over 8 000 students who have outstanding debt to be allowed to register. It has also made an appeal to civil society to raise over R2-million to help students at risk of financial exclusion. “We submitted a memorandum of demands, 10 demands and they didn’t even agree to one. We have over 8 000 students who are at financial risk and the university still has no clear plan on how to save those students. We continue to raise money but our efforts continue to fall short. The protest and the demonstrations will continue tomorrow and until we get our demands,” says Mpendulo Mfeka, Wits SRC President. The Wits SRC has exhausted all negotiations, we have taken it to picket lines!

He says the demand speaks to the fact that most people lost livelihoods.
