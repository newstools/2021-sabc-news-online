A 34-year-old woman who is the alleged mastermind of her husband’s murder and her co-accused have been denied bail by the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court in Limpopo on Thursday. Ntanganedzeni Nemaranzhe and her three co-accused, Tshivhangwaho Mudau, Tshililo Madega and Takalani Nemutandani allegedly murdered businessman, Azwifaneli Mudau on Valentine’s Day in 2019. Mudau was shot dead in front of his gate in Makwarela, outside Thohoyandou. Nemaranzhe and her co-accused, Madega have been denied bail after launching their bail bid in January. The court denied them bail citing that they are a flight risk. The other two accused, Mudau and Nemutandani abandoned their bail application earlier. The matter has been postponed to the 14th of May for further investigations. During the bail proceeding last week, the court called a witness from Home Affairs to testify about the two identity books belonging to Nemaranzhe, the alleged mastermind behind the murder. In her second ID book, her identity appears as Luvhuwani Nemaranzhe Mudau while her first her ID book is in the name of Winnie Ntanganedzeni Nemaranzhe. All of them were arrested in December last year, 20 months after Azwifaneli Mudau’s killing. The fourth suspect in Mudau’s killing is now deceased. The man was allegedly killed by two of the accused, Madega and Nemutandanani, who are now facing a separate charge of murder.
