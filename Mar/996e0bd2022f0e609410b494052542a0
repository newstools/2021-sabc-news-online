Zimbabwe’s second Vice President Kembo Mohadi has resigned amidst sexual misconduct allegations. Earlier this year, three audio recordings made the rounds on social media of Mohadi apparently soliciting sexual favours from different women. He has denied the allegations – claiming they are rumours part of a smear campaign. After mounting pressure from the public, advocacy groups and social media Mohadi has left office. In his resignation later, he insists that the allegations are “flames of lies which are muddling the reality of his family life”. He says this was sponsored political sabotage. Mohadi says his resignation will also allow him space and time to seek legal remedy to clear his name. In the recordings that surfaced, a man can be heard scheduling to have sex at his office. The man is allegedly Mohadi. The women on the other end of the line are believed to be subordinates working in his office. The 71-year-old has thanked the nation for their support during his tenure.
