People Living with Disabilities say their rights are infringed as access to education, housing and basic services is still a challenge for them. Disability and Older Person Party marked Human Rights Day in Hazyview, Mpumalanga. The group also celebrated the official registration of the party with the IEC. Tryphina Sithole, who is blind, says she often feels forgotten and neglected by government and society. She says her rights too are important. “Our rights are being violated, because they don’t care for us, the government priorities the community and do nothing for us, yet we voted for changed and to be cared for,” says Sithole. Despite government social grant, they want more to be done. Resident, Sophie Ngomane says, “We are struggling, I have three mentally challenged children, yes the grant is helping us but I wish this new party can help us for really care for our children with disabilities.” The residents claim government is unable to implement policies aimed at improving their lives and say they hope that the Disability and Older Person Party is the answer. The President of Disability and Older Person Party, Doctor Maesela, says, “We want to be the watchdog and monitor those policies. Our organisation is focused in the rural area where the elderly cant fetch water from water tankers, most of the road are not accessible to people who are suing wheelchairs. When you go to people with disability is difficult to have access to school.” The party says it received a certificate of registration from IEC this month and it will be contesting the upcoming local government elections.
