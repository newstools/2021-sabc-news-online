The drought-stricken Makana Municipality in Makhanda in the Eastern Cape has promised to restore water to full capacity soon. Makana municipality implemented water restrictions after a mechanical failure at the James Kleynhans Water Treatment Works which supplies the east side of Makhanda, leaving residents without water for three weeks. Municipal Mayor Mzukisi Mpahlwa says they have in place contingency plans to avert a similar situation in the future. Mpahlwa says, “Of the plant that we have we are going to have an additional pump which will be the fifth pump which will act as the spare wheel so that in the event there is any crisis in any of the four pumps. This spare one can kick in. So we don’t have a situation where residents do not have water.” “That’s what we are going to do going forward so the residents can rely on the reliable source of water that is coming from the taps.,” says Mpahlwa.

Makana Municipal Infrastructure Director Asanda Gidana says the demand is higher than the supply. Gidana says, “Right now with all the problems and the fact that people have been without water for three weeks so you find out the effects of telegraphic cause. You find people are in low-lying areas, others in the high lying areas. Not everyone gets equitable distribution at once. And some of the businesses will have reserves that are depleted due to the fact that there had been due to the fact they placed over-reliance during this problem.” Makhanda water struggle | Water tankers deployed to supply residents
