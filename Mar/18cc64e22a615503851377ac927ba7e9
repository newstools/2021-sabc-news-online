City Power says it’ll take a day or two to rebuild and repair the tower and damaged lines that have left large parts of Johannesburg without electricity since last night. The power supply to several substations was disrupted after a tree fell on one of the power lines. Affected areas stretch from Parktown and Auckland Park to Naturena and Eldorado Park, south of the city. City Power spokesperson, Isaac Mangena, explains: “The technicians are still on site reconstructing the pylon and working on restoring the remaining portion of the power outage. There was a planned outage scheduled for the 4th of April to cut the very same trees however arrangements have been made to cut them before Mayfair substation is restored.” #OUTAGEUPDATE – #MAYFAIR
Earlier assessments suggested that it may take a day or two to rebuild the damaged tower, repair the lines, and restore power.
However, City Power teams managed to fix one line which will ensure that power is restored to all affected customers by 16h30. pic.twitter.com/XLKkPwnXhY — @CityPowerJhb (@CityPowerJhb) March 30, 2021  #FountainbleauPlannedOutage fully restored, all affected customers restored.
