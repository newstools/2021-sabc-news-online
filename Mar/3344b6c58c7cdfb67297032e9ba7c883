The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) says it has increased its deployments in and around the Johannesburg CBD, where students are expected to resume with protests on Monday morning. Last week, scores of students from Wits University took to the streets to protest against the non-registration of students who still owe the institution money. Students from the University of Johannesburg also joined in on the protest. JMPD Spokesperson Xolani Fihla says, “JMPD officers are on high alert as we are expecting students to continue with their protest action in the Braamfontein Precinct, Jhb CBD and in Auckland Park. From last week’s protest action we have noticed that several roads were affected as the students were marching and picketing. These include Jossion, Yale and Empire Road. Officers will be present to divert traffic and alleviate congestion. We are appealing to motorists exercise caution and be patient at that moment.” Sasco calls for a national shutdown of institutions of higher learning:  Meanwhile, the South African Union of Students (SAUS) has warned of a national shutdown. They say Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande failed to respond to their memorandum which had a deadline of 5pm on Friday. In the memorandum, they had outlined a list of student’s demands including clearing of historical debt for all students and registration for all first-year students to be allowed to proceed, while the government is still sorting out the funding challenges. They also want a 0% increase for the 2021 academic year. SAUS calls for a national shutdown of all of South Africa’s 26 universities
