Some experts say government still has no concrete vaccine rollout plan and is still way off its target of vaccinating healthcare workers. This as the country heads towards a third wave of coronavirus infections. This is expected in Gauteng in the next few months. Five hundred and ten new coronavirus infections have been recorded in South Africa in the past 24-hour cycle bringing the cumulative number of cases to 1 538 961. Latest COVID-19 infections:  Fifty-five more people have succumbed to COVID-19-related symptoms. This puts the national death toll at 52 251. Retired epidemiologist, Dr Jo Barnes says, “Vaccines that are available are better at coping with the variants but you know this is the most difficult virus we’ve ever come across and it just keeps on making more variants. So it will depend also on future variants – the one that is raging through Britain at the moment is 50% more contagious than the previous one. It’s not only what the vaccine can do, it also changes its habits and then becomes more infectious. So, a lot of it we are fighting in the dark, so to speak.” Below are the latest SA COVID-19 stats: SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 333 122 194 903 62 921 73 929 11 347 2 083 1 334 DEATHS 3 575 11 430 10 142 1 413 794 86163 411 777 62 970 35 670 82 308 23 ﻿MARCH 2021 1 538 961 52 251 9 665 664 1 465 204 510 55 Vaccination Rollout 194 257 Healthcare workers vaccinated 281 361 10 133  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
