The African National Congress (ANC) has vowed to take strong action against members who are sowing divisions in the organisation. This comes after the National Executive Committee (NEC) held its meeting at the weekend. In the video below, Party President Cyril Ramaphosa delivers the NEC closing address:  The meeting resolved to instruct all members facing criminal charges to step-aside or face suspension. Ramaphosa has warned the so-called Radical Economic Transformation (RET) campaigners to refrain from embarking on factional campaigns. “The NEC condemned the establishment of groups operating as an organised faction within the ANC to undermine the ideological and organisational integrity of the ANC. The meeting agreed that no ANC member should associate themselves with or be involved in the so-called ‘RET Forces’. Furthermore, the NEC will not allow any member of the ANC staff to use the resources and premises of the ANC to hold meetings of the RET or any other faction,” adds Ramaphosa. Magashule to consult previous ANC leaders over step-aside matter Meanwhile, ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule is still mulling over the NEC’s instruction that he step aside. Although Magashule initially resisted stepping aside, the party’s president says Magashule has now opted to seek advice from past leaders. “The NEC welcomed the decision by the ANC Secretary-General, Cde Ace Magashule, to use this time to seek the counsel of past leaders of the movement and the ANC supports our Secretary-General in this effort,” says Ramaphosa.
