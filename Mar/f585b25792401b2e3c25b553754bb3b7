The four police officers arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of Mthokozisi Ntumba during student protests in Braamfontein, last week, will be appearing in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) arrested the officers from the Public Order Policing (POP) unit on Monday. Ntumba was shot dead during clashes between protesting Wits students and the police. The 35-year-old Ntumba was not part of the protest but was caught between the police and protesting students as he was leaving a local clinic. His death has left his family in shock. Bheki Cele says justice needs to happen in the shooting of Mthokozisi Ntumba:  They say the young, married father of three, still had much to live for. Shortly after his death, Police Minister visited the family to pay his condolences and to assure them that justice will be served. The arrested officers are likely to be charged with murder, attempted murder and defeating the ends of justice at their first appearance in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court.
