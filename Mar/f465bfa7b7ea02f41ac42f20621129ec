Statistics South Africa’s Quarterly Employment Statistics indicates a quarterly increase of 76 000 jobs in the fourth quarter of 2020 from the third quarter of 2020.  However, on an annual basis total employment decreased by 594 000 between December 2019 and December 2020. Most job gains were reported in part-time employment with a net increase of 87 000, while full-time jobs decreased by 11 000.  The job increases were mostly in the trade, community services, and business services sectors. Statistics South Africa says the retail sector led the way creating 54 000 new jobs. It was followed by the public sector, which took on board 51 000 new employees and the private sector added a modest 4 000 new jobs. There were decreases in the construction, manufacturing, transport, and mining sectors. The survey further indicates that Basic salaries paid to employees increased by R18.6 billion in December 2020 from September of the same year. The Quarterly employment statistics is an enterprise-based survey that collects information from non-agricultural businesses and organisations from approximately 20 000 units. Not to be confused with the Quarterly labour force survey, it collects data on the labour market activities of individuals from 30 000 households. Cosatu reacts to the news in the video below:
