The Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport has appointed senior counsel to lead an independent investigation to determine the circumstances surrounding the drowning of two children near a road construction site in Mamelodi, Tshwane, last Saturday. The two boys aged 4 and 7,  from Kapanong informal settlement, drowned in a quarry at a construction site that is part of upgrades being done to Solomon Mahlangu Drive. The Department’s Melita Madiba says Advocate Thomas Bokaba has been appointed to investigate the facts and establish accountability for the tragedy, as well as failures on the part of the department and contractor. MEC Jacob Mamabolo stressed that although the investigation has been commissioned by the Department, it will be completely independent of the Department, and the findings and recommendations will be those of the investigator alone. The Department’s role will be to provide the investigator with access to all materials and information within its power and control that the investigator regards as relevant to the purposes of the investigation. The report shall be completed and delivered to the Department as soon as is reasonably possible, bearing in mind the need for a thorough investigation. The findings and recommendations shall be disclosed publicly.
