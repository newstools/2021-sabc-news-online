Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has opened a crimen injuria and contempt case against Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula at the Brooklyn Police Station in Pretoria. This follows Mbalula’s tweet over the weekend where he said Mkhwebane was not Public Protector but a “hired gun.” Mkhwebane says Mbalula is one of the few members of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s executive she had complaints against. Others are Finance Minister Tito Mboweni and Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe. Mkhwebane says she wrote to President Ramaphosa calling for action against them. She says Mbalula is in violation of section 181 subsection three of the constitution. Mkhwebane’s Spokesperson Oupa Segalwe says Mbalula must assist and protect Chapter 9 institutions. “Other organs of states and this includes state functionary such as Minister Mbalula must assist and protect Chapter 9 institutions to ensure their independence, impartiality, dignity and effectiveness. This provision is exactly like section 165 subsection 4 of the constitution which is applicable to the judiciary and yet, we have a member of the executive going around injuring at will the dignity of the head of an independent constitutional institution.” ANC divided over Mkhwebane The African National Congress (ANC) is seemingly divided on the forthcoming vote by Members of Parliament on establishing the inquiry into Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fate hangs in the balance:  ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule has reportedly called on his party’s MPs to block the Democratic Alliance (DA)’s motion in the National Assembly to establish an impeachment inquiry into Mkhwebane. He said there is no way the ANC can support the enemy of the revolution, the DA. However, Mbalula tweeted, saying Mkhwebane is a “hired gun (and) not the Public Protector.” Mbalula asked which NEC had resolved to defend Mkhwebane.
