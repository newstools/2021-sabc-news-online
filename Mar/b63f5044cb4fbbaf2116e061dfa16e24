Speculation is rife on social media on the whereabouts of Tanzania’s President, John Pombe Magufuli. One Kenyan newspaper alleges that he may be admitted to one of the country’s private hospitals. Opposition leader Tundu Lissu has questioned Magufuli’s whereabouts as he has not been seen in public for two weeks now. While the Kenyan Newspaper did not mention the Tanzanian head of state by name, it described his government’s reluctance to adhere to COVID-19 protocols. It quoted diplomatic sources indicating that the leader has been on a ventilator and that he has been ailing for weeks now. The report further says he arrived in Kenya on Monday. Meanwhile, Kenya’s former opposition leader Raila Odinga is said to be admitted at the same hospital after he complained of fatigue. The 76–year–old politician has been on the campaign trail to popularise an initiative aimed at changing the Constitution.
