The newly appointed Co-Chair of the Ministerial Advisory Committee (MAC) on COVID-19 Professor Kholeka Mlisana has appealed for South Africans to strictly adhere to any further coronavirus restrictions, expected to be imposed by government, ahead of the Easter Weekend. Professor Mlisana was appointed as the new Chairperson of the MAC after Professor Salim Abdool Karim resigned. Karim tendered his resignation, indicating that he wants to return to the work he was doing on HIV research and innovation before his appointment. The Committee has voiced concern over a potential third wave of coronavirus infections, following the Easter holiday period. Mlisana says people must try to avoid large gatherings. “Make sure that we try as much as we can to prevent any large gatherings that might trigger the infections. It is going to be important that we adhere to whatever restrictions that government is going to come up with. I know that we are facing Easter weekend in a few days and it is important that we stick to whatever numbers that government is going to give to us because remember that wherever there are huge gatherings, that is where we create super spreader events and we want to avoid that.” Professor Mlisana on her appointment:
