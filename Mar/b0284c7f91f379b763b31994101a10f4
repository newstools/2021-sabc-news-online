Consumer price inflation (CPI) slowed to 2,9 percent year-on-year in February from 3,2 percent in January. According to data from Statistics South Africa, this is the lowest reading since June last year. The biggest contributors to the decline came from lower increases in medical services and food inflation. The data shows that higher fuel price increases didn’t add significant upward pressure on consumer inflation. Core inflation, which excludes prices of food, non-alcoholic beverages, fuel and energy, was at 2,6 percent year-on-year in February, from 3,3 percent previously. Statistics South Africa’s Patrick Kelly, “Households are paying on average 4.3 percent more for medical-related services than they did a year ago. This increase is lower than the annual rate recorded in 2020 of 9 percent. Annual inflation for food and non-alcoholic beverages was 5.2 percent in February, down from the 6 month high of 6 percent recorded in December. At 4.6 percent annual bread and cereal inflation was slightly off from its 12 month high of 5.1 percent in January. White bread increased by 8 percent while super maize meal declined by 3.5 percent.” Latest economic data The rand is trading at 14, 87 to the dollar, 20, 35 to the pound and 17, 56 to the euro.
