KwaZulu-Natal Ezemvelo Wildlife and the SPCA have seized close to 100 Vervet monkeys that were allegedly illegally kept at the Umsizi Umkomaas Vervet Monkey Rescue Centre on the south coast. It is alleged that the owner of the centre failed to comply with a notice that was issued in February, to remove the monkeys within 21 days. Ezemvelo spokesperson Musa Mntambo says, “The owner was charged with breaking two sections of the national conservation ordinance 15 of 1974. She was charged and was given a R1500 fine.” “All Vervet monkeys were removed by Ezemvelo Game capture unit and will be disposed of in accordance with the international union for conservation of nature guidelines for placement of confiscated animals. These guidelines include returning confiscated animals to the wild, returning confiscated animals to captivity, lastly euthanasia.” Report by Nonhlakanipho Magwaza
