Former Eskom Group CEO, Matshela Koko, returns to the State Capture Commission that’s sitting in Johannesburg on Monday. On Thursday, former Eskom board chair, Zola Tsotsi, responded to allegations by some Eskom witnesses that in 2015 he suggested that certain Eskom executives be suspended. Witnesses alleged that Tsotsi asked the executives – including the power utility’s then CEO Tshediso Matona – to step aside while an independent investigation be concluded against them. The executives are alleged to have been removed from the entity to pave way for Gupta associates. Tsotsi also answered to Koko’s allegations that he had tried to get rid of the former Eskom Group CEO at the time of the executives’ suspension. Tsotsi dismissed the claims as disingenuous, saying he actually had a lot to do with Koko’s rise at Eskom. He accused Koko of trying to create non-existent conflict between them.
