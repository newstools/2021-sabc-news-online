The South African Broadcasting Corporation has expressed shock and sadness at the passing of former SABC Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO), Peter Matlare. The 61-year-old Matlare passed away on Sunday due to COVID19-related complications. Matlare was at the helm of the public broadcaster from January 2001 until January 2005, a period which saw the corporation post positive profit results. In a statement SABC Board Chairperson, Bongumusa Makhathini, says Matlare’s legacy at the SABC was felt for years following his departure, and the organisation will continue to learn from the lessons and foundation he left behind. “He will forever be remembered for being a remarkable business executive, whose tenure at the SABC and subsequent companies he led left a blueprint on how to run successful businesses. “The SABC Board, management and staff, sends its heartfelt condolences to the Matlare family, his friends and his past and present colleagues,” he says. Tributes pour in for Peter Matlare:  Matlare’s relatives have said family was a cornerstone of the late Deputy CEO of Absa. Describing him as a pillar of strength,  the family says he used his talent and passion for cooking to regularly gather them for Sunday lunches, and maintain deep connections.
