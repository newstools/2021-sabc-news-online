Public Service and Administration Minister, Senzo Mchunu, says the level of professionalism among health workers at Sir Henry Elliot Hospital in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, is outstanding. Mchunu was on a COVID- 19 vaccination roll-out monitoring visit in Mthatha. More than 3 000 health workers have been vaccinated at the Sir Henry Elliot Hospital. Mchunu is pleased and has called other people to come forward for vaccination. “We are satisfied with the storage and the professionalism we saw there, the skill and level of professionalism and activities, it is quite respectable.” One of the frontline workers, Lungile Madikizela, is among the health workers that have been vaccinated. He has called upon his colleagues to come forward and take their coronavirus vaccine. “I feel a little bit safe, I think I am on the safer side now that I have been vaccinated. I just hope that this vaccination is going to work.  I was a little bit anxious but I am fine now, I have to be cool and I have hope that this vaccine is going to work for us and I also encourage people to come and vaccinate, to make sure that we are safe before the third wave comes.” Zoleka Ngxongolo says she has ignored myths and unscientific theories about vaccination. “I am feeling very fine, I do not have a headache because some of my colleagues said they feel the headache and so forth, I am feeling fine and I am happy.” Clinical Researcher, Dr Pam Mda, says the vaccination process is promising. “As of yesterday we have vaccinated more than 3 000 people, but looking at the numbers here we are looking at 500 people before the end of the day, so this is just an initial stage than what we are looking for.” The rolling out of the vaccine will be extended to other regions in the province to ensure that frontline health workers are safe from contracting the virus.
