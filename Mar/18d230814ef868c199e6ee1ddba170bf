Twitter Inc is aiming to make its live audio feature available to all its users by April, a spokesperson for the micro-blogging site said on Thursday. Twitterâ€™s Spaces competes with Clubhouse, which is an invite-only audio-based social network startup that shot to fame after appearances from tech celebrities Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. In late February, Twitter was testing the feature with 1 000 users that began with women and people from marginalised groups.
