In this video below, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi is addressing the traditional leaders in Nongoma:  Zuma was expected to go to KwaKhethomthandayo royal palace at Nongoma but has since re-scheduled. Zuma says the King’s role in uplifting the Zulu nation will always be remembered. “To the subjects of the King, it is a great loss that our King is no more. We are deeply saddened as the King was our father and the father of our nation. We are speechless and the King was everything to all of us. We are in pain as the King was also our wisdom. We send our condolences to the nation, the royal family, and the institution of traditional leaders. Political parties, including the African National Congress (ANC) and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), have conveyed their sadness following the passing of  King. The National People’s Front (NAPF), the break-away party from the National Freedom Party, has expressed its condolences to the King’s family. The leader of the party, Bheki Gumbi, said the King’s passing is painful and the NAPF has no words to describe the pain it is feeling. He said the party regards this day as a black Friday for the Zulu Nation and the KwaZulu-Natal province. The ANC has described the late King as a courageous leader, who was concerned about the well-being of all South Africans regardless of their tribe. King Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu passed away from COVID-19 complications in a Durban hospital. He was 72. The king was admitted to ICU in hospital last month for diabetes.
