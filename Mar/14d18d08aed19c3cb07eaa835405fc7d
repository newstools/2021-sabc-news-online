Gauteng Health MEC Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi says the province is clamping down on fraud in relation to the Electronic Vaccination Data System, known as EVD. Yesterday, SABC News reported that some private healthcare workers had been manipulating the EVD system to get their wives and employees vaccinated, even though they are not frontline healthcare workers. MEC Mokgethi says government has stepped up efforts to root out the vaccine fraud. “In the public sector, we are really checking the numbers with regard to the people that are registering. Before you get vaccinated, you must be able to produce your voucher and then we check you in the system. If you are not in the system, you are not getting vaccinated. We are trying to close that gap,” she explains. Mokgethi and Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, today observed shots being administered at the Milpark Private Hospital in Johannesburg. The hospital, one of six dedicated vaccination sites, has thus far inoculated over 4 000 healthcare workers. Wonderful energy in the area. Thank you to each and everyone for your time and efforts at various stages of the response to this pandemic. We learn every day and learn from you. Thank you for your sacrifices pic.twitter.com/DnLVjJ1bJb — Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi (@DrMokgethi) March 11, 2021  More than 31 000 healthcare workers across the province have received their shots. Premier Makhura says he is pleased with the progress of vaccinations in the province and that the response of the healthcare workers has been fantastic. He says Gauteng is ready to receive the next batch of vaccines as the current one has been depleted. Premier indeed is correct that we have had great response from healthcare workers through the Sisonke Vaccination Programme, and we are eager to begin the phase where we focus on other categories of the population ahead of the winter period. pic.twitter.com/YZgL2LycI9 — Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi (@DrMokgethi) March 11, 2021
