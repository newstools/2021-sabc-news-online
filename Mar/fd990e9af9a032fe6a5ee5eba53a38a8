Today marks a year since the first COVID-19 related death was reported in South Africa on the 27th March 2020,  just hours after the country entered a level five lockdown. The first lockdown was initially supposed to last just three weeks,  but the country continues in lockdown – one year later. It was initially announced that two COVID-19 related deaths had been reported on the morning of 27th March last year. One patient was 48, while and the other was 28. Both were female. However, it later turned out that that the 28-year-old patient’s death was not COVID-19 related,  as the test results came back negative. File Video: Vanessa Poonah reports on the reported deaths in Western Cape:  The 48-year-old woman from the Western Cape, therefore, became the first victim of COVID-19 in South Africa. On that day, Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize had announced that the deceased had an underlying condition, called pulmonary embolism.
