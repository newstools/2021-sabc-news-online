Suliman is attributing this to the relaxed lockdown level one regulations and this new trend needs to be nipped in the bud. “There’s certainly a change in the trajectory that we have seen over the previous eight weeks. It’s something that we do need to take note of. With increased mobility, mobility data confirming increased movement across provinces and out of residential areas as well as an increase in gatherings it would be naïve to ignore the fact that we possibly starting to see the effects of the change into the level one restrictions and we hope to try and nip this in the bud before it grows any further. Hopefully it’s just a slight hiccup or a slight speed bump as a start of a mountain ahead,” he says. Discussion on COVID-19 statistics in SA:
