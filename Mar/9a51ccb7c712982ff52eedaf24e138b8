Employees at the Ndwedwe local municipality, north of Durban, have downed tools over alleged corruption. They are accusing the municipal manager of maladministration and for not following proper procedures in hiring processes. Local Chairperson of the South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu), Fuzile Nkosi says they are calling for the council to remove the municipal manager. “As Samwu, we wrote a letter to the mayor and the speaker calling for an investigation about allegations laid against the municipal manager. Firstly, the report of the AG indicated that since the arrival of MM Radebe, irregular expenditure has escalated. That’s why our municipality is dysfunctional. The tender system is not followed properly. Also, the issues of hiring people, recruitment and selection process is no longer followed.” Ndwedwe Mayor Nkosinathi Chili says they are expected to convene an executive council meeting on Wednesday to try and find a solution. “Those allegations have never been tested because we have to follow the procedures. As a council, we have decided to call a special exco. And then after special exco, we will take the recommendation to the council so that the council will discuss this matter and recommend what needs to be done regarding the allegation that has been brought forward by the municipal workers. This strike has an impediment on the service delivery. So, it’s important to find an amicable solution as quick as possible.”
