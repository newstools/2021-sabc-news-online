The SABC says it will not close its isiNdebele radio station, Ikwekwezi, but rather relocate it to the public broadcaster’s headquarters in Auckland Park, Johannesburg, later this year. SABC Chief Operations Officer, Ian Plaatjes, has confirmed that the decision to move the Ikwekwezi studio and personnel to Johannesburg is a business decision aimed at cutting costs. “We are not closing the radio station, we still have growth plans for the radio station. Whether they are located in Pretoria or Auckland Park doesn’t change the strategy of the radio station at all. It’s about reducing our operating cost,” adds Plaatjes.
