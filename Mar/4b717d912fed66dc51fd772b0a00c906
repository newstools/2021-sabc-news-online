Tributes are pouring in for late veteran actor, Menzi Ngubane. Ngubane passed away on Saturday and had been battling ill health for years now. I have just lost a friend who welcomed me in Jhb in 1993 and moved into my flat in Berea to stay with me full time. I have lost a TV coach, passionate music lover, a real Buccaneer and someone we shared and exchanged clothes with. I loved this man, Ngubs pic.twitter.com/8G8lYg0wHL — putco mafani (@PutcoMafani) March 13, 2021  Ngubane, aged 56, had a long career as an actor; having starred in productions like Iliwa libhek’umoya and Generations. The announcement of his death comes amid the news of the passing of veteran actress, Noxolo Maqashalala. The 44-year-old’s body was reportedly found on Friday at her home in Honeydew, Johannesburg. Maqashalala is known for her roles in Tsha Tsha and Intersexions. South Africans have taken to social media to pay homage to the duo. Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula, says both artists have made a remarkable and immense contribution to television and arts in South Africa. South Africa has lost great talents. Both Menzi and Noxolo were remarkable and had an immense contribution to television and arts in our country.
