The commemoration of the Langa Massacre at Kariega, formerly Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape, has been postponed until further notice. The families of the victims did not want the planned activities to take place, saying government had failed to fulfil promises made to them. More than 20 people, on their way to a funeral, were shot and killed by the police on this day at KwaLanga in 1985. Twenty-seven others were injured. Tempers flared in a meeting between the victims’ families and local ANC leaders, trying to resolve the impasse. The meeting collapsed and was later reconvened. Consensus was reached to postpone the commemoration:  “We just want a few things from government. We want houses, jobs and food parcels every month but our government is failing to provide that. We want President Ramaphosa to intervene and resolve this issue with the leaders. This is painful,” says one of the victims’ relatives, Ntomboxolo Nxele. ANC Nelson Mandela Bay RTT Coordinator, Luyolo Nqakula, says: “There are commitments, which have been made to them. Some known to us and some not known to us. So we are engaged in a process of following-up that now with government itself. So you find a situation where there is high-level of frustration informed by the realities they are confronted with to an extent of having a feeling they are not taken seriously. They are taken for granted.” Former Deputy Finance Minister, Mcebisi Jonas, was scheduled to deliver the keynote address at the event. The 1985 Langa Massacre coincided with the 25th anniversary of the Sharpeville Massacre, where 69 people were shot by security police when protesting against the apartheid government pass laws.
