He has proposed that Harvard University and Stellenbosch University collaborate to write a concept paper which will promote social justice. Benson says the universities should set up a commission to continue the social justice work that Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King were known for.

It’s incumbent on the government and business, the educational community and the cultural community to make sure that we fix that. It sounds simplistic, but it’s absolutely doable and I think it’s doable because it is simplistic.”  The 2nd Annual #socialjusticeday #SocialJusticeLecture starts now… Join here: https://t.co/I3kiF2ZIJa#SocialJusticeMPlan #SocialJusticeLecture pic.twitter.com/xKaH5XgCvW — Social Justice Chair (@CFSJ_MPlan) March 23, 2021  Meanwhile, Madonsela says South Africa’s Constitution is already playing a key role in addressing injustices of the past.
