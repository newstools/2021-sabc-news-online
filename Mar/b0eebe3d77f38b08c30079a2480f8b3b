President Cyril Ramaphosa has met with a delegation of the National Khoi-San Council (NKC) ahead of the commencement of the Traditional and Khoi-San Leadership Act to be implemented on April 1. The Act comes after countless efforts from the Khoi-San community to be recognised. The Bill was sent for promulgation to the President after it was passed by the National Council of Provinces in Parliament in 2019. Once signed into law, the Bill will give recognition to traditional structures in the various Khoisan communities, the Kings, Queens and chiefs; and it has been widely welcomed. The Khoi-San delegation was led by its chairperson, Cecil Le Fleur. Acting spokesperson to the President, Tyrone Seale, says Ramaphosa has commended the Council for its efforts over many years to ensure recognition of the status of Khoi-San communities. “The meeting discussed the need for members of the Khoi-San communities to be involved in land reform programmes and rural economic development. It also discussed transitional issues during the implementation of the Traditional and Khoi-San Leadership Act. The President applauded the Khoisan national council for its efforts over many years to ensure recognition of the Khoi-San in communities. The President reaffirmed government’s commitment to ensure the effective implementation of the Act and the integration of the Khoi-San into traditional leadership structures.” [Photos] President @CyrilRamaphosa met with a delegation of the National Khoi-San Council.
