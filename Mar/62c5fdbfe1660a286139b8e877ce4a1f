Judgment is expected to be handed down by the North West High Court in Mahikeng in the case of former Provincial Deputy Police Commissioner William Mpembe and three others on Monday. Mpembe along with Gideon van Zyl‚ Dingaan Madoda‚ and Oupa Pule are charged with defeating the ends of justice after they failed to report the death in custody of Modisaotsile Sagalala who was shot during the Marikana unrest in 2012. Instead, they recorded that he died at a nearby hospital. Mpembe allegedly also gave false evidence at the Farlam Commission of Inquiry. The four are charged with contravening the Commission Act, contravening the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) Act, and defeating the ends of justice.-Reporting by Sylvester Serame The video below is reporting on the Marikana trial at the North West High Court:
