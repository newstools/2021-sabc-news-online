Gauteng’s Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Lebogang Maile has written to City Johannesburg Mayor Geoff Makhubo requesting that he responds within three days on what the terms and conditions of the “mutual termination of employment” between the City and the former City Manager entail. The City issued a statement on Tuesday saying that the City and its manager, Ndivhoniswani Lukhwareni, have agreed on a mutual termination of employment effective 28 February 2021. Maile also wants Makhubo to present him with the initial employment contract as well as any settlement agreement entered into between the City and Lukhwareni. DA Joburg Caucus leader, Councillor Leah Knott says they believe Lukhwareni is being made a scapegoat for COVID-19-related corruption. “I repeat my concerns that he is being made a scapegoat for Geoff Makhubo’s failings in the city, which include over R400 million in corrupt COVID expenditure along with service delivery falling apart. In an election year, we have to worry that Dr Lukwareni is being pushed aside to make way for a more compliant cadre, who will enable looting to fund the campaign of a financially bankrupt ANC.” Should the tender system be re-examined following PPE corruption?
