Gauteng has depleted its stock of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine for healthcare workers. Thirty-one thousand healthcare workers have been vaccinated in the province since the arrival of the first two batches totalling 160 000 doses of J&J vaccines arrived in the country last month. Another 340 000 doses are expected in the next few weeks. Gauteng Premier David Makhura and the Health MEC Nomathemba Mokgethi yesterday observed the jabs being administered at the Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg. Over 4 000 healthcare workers have been vaccinated at the hospital thus far. Premier Makhura says “In our province, the sites were extended from just two. An additional four sites were added. Our province by yesterday (Wednesday) vaccinated 31 000 healthcare workers. By the end of today (Thursday), we would have completed all the doses that have been given in Gauteng.” He adds: “Here at Milpark, we would have vaccinated 3900. Gauteng is ready for the next batch of vaccine doses that are arriving next week. By the end of tomorrow (Friday), all our sites in the province would have completed whatever is allocated.” Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize said on Thursday evening that 138 014 of the country’s 1.2 million healthcare workers have been vaccinated so far.
