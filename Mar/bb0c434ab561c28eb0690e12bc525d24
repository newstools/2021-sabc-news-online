The Democratic Alliance says it will lodge a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) against the police and the National Forensic Science Laboratory (NFSL) over a backlog in DNA testing at the labs. The party’s Shadow Minister for Police Andrew Whitfield says the Forensic Division’s failure to process DNA samples within a reasonable period is affecting the ability of thousands of South Africans to access justice. He says the situation is allowing violent rapists and murderers to be released and to offend again with impunity. Whitfield says Police Minister Bheki Cele and National Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole should be held accountable for the backlog.
