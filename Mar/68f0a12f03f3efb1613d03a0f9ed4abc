The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) says it has decided to release the online driver’s license booking slots in a staggered manner in an effort to make them available to as many people as possible. The Gauteng online driving licence booking system has left many people frustrated, and not being able to book slots to do their learner drivers’ test or renew their motor vehicle licenses. In the video below, National Driving School Association of SA wants online booking system scrapped:  On Friday, operators of driving schools marched to the RTMC’s offices in Centurion demanding that the corporation ask the Department of Transport to respond to their memorandum of grievances. In February, they submitted a memorandum to the Department of Transport demanding the online booking for driver’s learners examinations, testing for driver’s license and for renewal of license disk be scrapped. RTMC spokesperson, Simon Zwane, says the slots are made available by the various driver license and testing centres for them to put online. “Slots are made available almost every hour until 8 in the evening. They get taken very quickly because of the high demand.  We also note that if slots were made available all at once, there were people who were able to hog those slots. They’ve employed a number of people who were able to get into the online platform and book as many slots as available and that makes the slots not available to as many people,” explains Zwane.
