Two police officers have appeared at Durban Magistrate’s Court, facing charges of corruption. It’s alleged that the officers demanded a R600 bribe in order to release a victim who had stolen a cellphone. Hawks Spokesperson, Philani Nkwalase, says the victim had already paid R400 for his release. “Sergeant Nonkuthalo Fodo aged 42 and Constable Bokang Wiseman Ramabele aged 34 allegedly demanded R600 gratification in order to release the victim who had stolen a cellphone and later returned it to the lawful owner who decided not to lay criminal charges against him on the 5th of March last year. They are expected to be back in the same court on the 7th of April 2021,” says Nkwalase. Guns found In the Western Cape, police have recovered two firearms in Khayelitsha on the Cape Flats belonging to police officers who were gunned down in Kraaifontein last weekend. Police Ministry Spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, says nine suspects have been arrested for possession of unlicensed firearms following an intelligence-driven operation overnight. Sergeant Mnakwazo Mdoko and Constable Mninawa Breakfast were gunned down in Bloekombos while on patrol last weekend. Themba says two seized firearms have been positively identified to belong to the deceased. One suspect has already appeared in court for the murders and investigations into the incident are continuing.
