As thousands of people are preparing to travel to various destinations across the country for the Easter weekend, there are renewed concerns of a COVID-19 resurgence. Johannesburg Transport MMC, Nonhlanhla Makhuba, today visited the Wanderers Taxi Rank, in Johannesburg, where long queues of people preparing to board minibus taxis that will take them home to see their extended families have begun forming. She spoke to taxi operators about making sure their vehicles are roadworthy and that they are responsible behind the wheel. Makhuba also encouraged passengers to wear their masks and to sanitise. Discussion on the safety and effectiveness of masks in curbing the spread of COVID-19:    There has been called for stricter COVID-19 restrictions, ahead of the long weekend, to avoid a third wave of infections. South Africans will find out later today whether government has heeded to those calls when President Cyril Ramaphosa addresses the nation later tonight.
