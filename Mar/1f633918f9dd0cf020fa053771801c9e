Other speakers include retired judge Siraj Desai and top cop and former MK operative, Jeremy Vearey. Boesak has also described Esau’s leadership as selfless. Esau also studied at the University of the Western Cape where a student hostel was named after him. In June 2016, Tshisimani hosted a series of events to mark 40 years since the 1976 uprising. #CecylEsau was among the older generation of activists who generously shared their reflections on the struggle against apartheid https://t.co/2rcjbaXp1v — Tshisimani (@Tshisimani) March 22, 2021  Retired High Court Judge, Siraj Desai, has paid tribute to Esau during his funeral service. Desai was Esau’s legal representative in many of his trials. “The trial was one of the first MK trials in the Cape. The trial was not run as in a criminal case of guilty or innocent. Here as much as we were counsels, we were hostages of the accused because their intent was to defeat the system, the intent was to run the trial in the interest of the ANC and Umkhonto Wesizwe.”
