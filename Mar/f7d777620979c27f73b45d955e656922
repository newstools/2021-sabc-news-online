Lobby group Afriforum says it has written to the National Prosecuting Authority to ask them to act swiftly to ensure the arrest of the alleged mastermind in the killing of former Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa. The five men implicated in the killing of the soccer star appeared in the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court east of Johannesburg on Friday. The case was transferred to the High Court and postponed to October 25th for trial. They face charges of murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances, attempted murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. Meyiwa was shot and killed in the Vosloorus in 2014. Afriforum is representing the Meyiwa family in the case. The lobby group’s Advocate Gerrie Nel says, “I really do hope that sanity will prevail and that before we go to trial that the NPA and police will decide to prosecute the mastermind. I wrote a letter yesterday to the NPA saying that it’s possible that the mastermind is protected from prosecution but we must just convince the NPA that there is enough evidence to prosecute the mastermind and indicate the irrationality of a failure to prosecute. So certainly the NPA act rationally and if they act irrationally one will have to have recourse to force them to do what is right.” I’m very disappointed that the mastermind has not been arrested: Gerrie Nel Meyiwa’s family says it had hoped the identity of the mastermind behind the killing would have been revealed in court on Friday. The family’s spokesperson, Siya Meyiwa, says it hopes the alleged mastermind will be arrested soon. “We were under the impression that key individuals, based on the theory that it was a planned murder, that the person who was sponsoring the whole thing would be appearing as well. So, we were expecting that, but we are greatly disappointed that none of them showed up,” says Meyiwa.
