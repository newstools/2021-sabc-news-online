In-person registrations at the Wits University’s Braamfontein Campus in Johannesburg have been halted by protests led by the Students Representative Council (SRC). Police have been called onto the campus. The Wits SRC says they want students who owe up to R150 000 to be allowed to register and sign an acknowledgment of debt. Students say Wits management is refusing this. SRC deputy president Sthembiso Dabula says they were left with no choice, but to disrupt the registration process. “You know the type of year 2020 was. With COVID-19, people lost their jobs. Students were defunded by bursaries. Students were defunded by NSFAS as well. So, how do you then say only students who are owing R10 000 and below are supposed to register wherein precedence shows that only students who were owing R120 000 were allowed to register. So, these concessions were not met but met with arrogance. The only thing they were able to do was to extend registration. So, it does not make sense for them to extend registration because it seems students are all of a sudden going to have money. Where are they going to get it from?” #wits #shutdown pic.twitter.com/1acJ8CMkJi — leadership (@lebonzaa) March 4, 2021
