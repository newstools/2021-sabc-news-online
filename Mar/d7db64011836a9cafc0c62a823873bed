The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg will hear further testimony from former Public Enterprises Minister Lynn Brown on Friday morning. The commission says in a statement that it will also hear from former Eskom secretary Suzanne Daniels. The commission hearings will continue into the evening with Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe and former Deputy Justice Minister Thabang Makwetla regarding the politically connected company, BOSASA. On Thursday, former Eskom Board member Mark Pamensky told the commission that he changed his mind about the suspension of four top executives of the power utility in 2015 because former Board Chairperson Zola Tsotsi tried to influence him to effect them at a Board meeting. The executives were suspended to enable an inquiry into their alleged wrongdoing at the power utility. Pamensky says Tsotsi told him that the suspensions had to take place because the executives could potentially interfere in the inquiry. “And then he mentions the four people and then I said I can understand they can put pressure on those people and. Then I said how can they put pressure on the CFO? I don’t see it and then that’s when Tsotsi said yes and the CFO was excluded. Later on, another member mentioned the CFO and I came back again protecting the CFO. We believed that this was a shot three-month inquiry. Therefore, it was potentially the tree that could interfere. I supported because Mr Tsotsi was pushing for misconduct and he explained misdemeanours.” The State Capture Commission hears Eskom related evidence:
