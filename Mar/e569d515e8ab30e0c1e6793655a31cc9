Eskom is pursuing civil action against its former CEO Brian Molefe and other former executives, with an aim of recovering billions of rands that were lost due to alleged state capture. The combined summons to the tune of R3.4 billion has been issued against all of the affected parties. The power utility says it has already made progress with recoveries emanating from corruption and irregularities dating back to 2018. At least R5 billion has been recovered. ABB to pay back R1.5 billion to Eskom:  ‘Fight far from over’ Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says although what has already been achieved in this regard is commendable, the fight is far from over. “The damage that was caused by state capture, whether it’s Medupi, Kusile, the procurement systems, the extraction of money in one form or another, the coal supplies that were disrupted; which today different people want to try and find different explanations for … but that was the reality that the Gupta family and their related entities did want to benefit from Eskom did benefit from Eskom.” Maintenance backlog At least more than a dozen of engineering, oil, chartered accountants, construction and other companies that allegedly milked the power utility are still being pursued. Eskom also announced that it still has a maintenance backlog that needed to be sorted out. To this extent, it has launched the reliability maintenance recovery programme, with the objective of dealing with load shedding. It says as it is still busy taking major units offline to carry out the required maintenance, the risk of load shedding gets elevated too. In addition to trying to recover its money and addressing the persistent issue of load shedding, Eskom is still facing a R480 billion debt burden.
