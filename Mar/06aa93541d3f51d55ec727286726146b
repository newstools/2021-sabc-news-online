Both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) have a packed programme this week. This includes the oral question and answer session with Deputy President David Mabuza, questions to several ministers, consideration of the 2021 Fiscal Framework and Revenue Proposals and sittings of 55 committee meetings. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga, Health Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize, Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister Dr. Blade Nzimande, as well as Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu, are some of those who will be answering questions in the National Assembly. Meanwhile, the Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development Thoko Didiza, and the Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Barbara Creecy, will do the same in the NCOP. Later in the week, the National Assembly will hold eight mini-plenaries.  Members of Parliament will debate among other things, the restructuring of the intelligence and security architecture, implications of privatising Eskom, as well as the growing crisis of unemployment and the need for government to prioritise opportunities for low and no-skilled South Africans. While Deputy President David Mabuza will answer questions in the NCOP on Thursday, there will also be a debate on minimum wages, negative consequences of government corruption on the people and development of the country, and why South Africa can no longer afford to delay implementing a Basic Income Grant. The Home Affairs committee will be briefed on the proposed amendments to the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill by the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC)  as well as on a matter of statelessness by Lawyers for Human Rights. In another development, the Caster Semenya Management will brief the Sport, Arts and Culture Committee on issues relating to her case on the new International Association of Athletics Federation Regulations.
