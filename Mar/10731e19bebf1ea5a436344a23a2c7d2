This week, as higher learning institutions opened their doors for the 2021 academic year, University of the Witwatersrand students took the streets in Braamfontein demanding that those who owe the university in fees still be allowed to register for 2021. One person was killed on Wednesday after police fired rubber bullets to disperse a group of protesters. But this is not the first protest around the fees at the university. In 2015, classes were suspended at Wits after students staged a sit-in rejecting the proposed tuition hike of 10.5%. That was the beginning of the #WitsFeeMustFall protest.
