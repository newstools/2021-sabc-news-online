The body of a man who has been missing for a week has been found floating in Silvermine Dam in Cape Town. Table Mountain National Park Manager Frans van Rooyen says the discovery follows a week-long search for 69-year-old Mike Reilly whose vehicle was discovered in the Silvermine parking area last Sunday. Reilly’s family has positively identified the body. No details of the cause of death have been given. Van Rooyen says they’ll soon announce when the dam will be reopened to the public. Meanwhile, in Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, police recovered a severely decomposed body of an unknown female that was found by community members in a dense bush at the Manor Sports grounds. #sapsKZN #SAPS Pietermaritzburg SAR & K9 SAR members recovered a severely decomposed body of an unknown female that was found by community members in a dense bush at the Manor Sports grounds.
