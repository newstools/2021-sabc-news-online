Eskom’s chief operating officer (COO) Jan Oberholzer has called on members of the public to brace themselves for more load shedding in the next five years. He says the power utility will continue its maintenance plans for its power stations despite a heightened risk of load shedding. Eskom which implemented load shedding last Thursday says it will continue until Wednesday. This as it struggles to generate adequate electricity to meet demand. Breakdowns and maintenance are the cause of inadequate power generation. Oberholzer briefed the media on Monday on the state of the status of the power grid. “Unfortunately this is what we have not done over the last decade or so, it’s reliability maintenance. However, it’s important to understand that if you take additional capacity out … although we are tight for supply to meet demand that means you have less that is available. And with our unpredictability of our system it makes it more challenging,” adds Oberholzer. Eskom briefs the media in the video below:
