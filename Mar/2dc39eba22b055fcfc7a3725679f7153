Kenya will observe seven days of national mourning following the death of Tanzania’s President, John Magufuli. The President of Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta, who is also the chairperson of the East African Community paid tribute to Magufuli describing him as a brother, friend and visionary Pan Africanist who put Africa first in all his leadership decisions. He reminisced their time together describing it as a time of deep reflection on the path the East African region should take towards integration. The United States Government and World Health Organisation Director General, Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, have expressed condolences to Tanzanians. The 61-year-old Magufuli passed away due to heart failure. He had last been seen on February 27 amid claims he had contracted COVID-19. However, his government has refuted the claims: Mangufuli decried lockdowns and was sceptical of COVID-19 drugs and suggested vaccines may be part of a foreign plot to steal Africa’s wealth. The government stopped reporting statistics for new cases and deaths in May last year when it had registered 509 cases and 21 deaths.  ‘Strong proponent of anti-corruption’ The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has lauded Tanzanian President John Magufuli for his Afro-centricism, saying he sought to build Tanzania outside of the overbearing scope of the Western world and its influence. The party in a brief statement says Magufuli lead his country with commitment, humility and always urged peaceful co-existence amongst his people. It says he was a strong proponent of anti-corruption and was passionate about development in Tanzania particularly education and infrastructure growth to modernise the East-African nation.
