The Tzaneen Magistrate’s Court has postponed to June the case against six people arrested for fraud related to a R2.4 million contract for the provision of 40 shacks at the Talana Hostel in Limpopo. The six, including a businesswoman and five officials from the Housing Development Agency, are out on bail. It is alleged that businesswoman, Constance Mohlala, and her company, which is the seventh accused before court, submitted fraudulent documents when bidding for the tender. The five other suspects Simphiwe Maphisa, Tsokollo Monareng, Lerato Lekhutso and the acting supply chain manager at the HDA, Jeremiah Makofane Nwere are members of the bid committee that recommended Mohlala’s company for the contract. Talana Project manager, Raymond Maoto, is also one of those who have been charged for the alleged crime. The court previously granted Mohlala R20 000 bail, while the HDA officials are each out on R10 000 bail. Each of the suspects face three charges of fraud, three of theft and three of forgery. Report on the arrest on two of the suspects:  Last year, the shacks sparked a public outcry after pictures of the ribbon cutting ceremony to unveil them went viral on social media. Premier Stan Mathabatha distanced himself from the project, saying he wasn’t aware about the poor quality of the structures when he went to the event. He said the shacks were a temporary measure aimed at alleviating overcrowding at the hostel and government was planning on building family units for the hostel dwellers.
