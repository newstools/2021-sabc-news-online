A traditional beehive-shaped Zulu grass-thatched hut is being built at the KwaKhethomthandayo Royal Palace where the late AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu’s body will be kept after being brought from the mortuary in Nongoma. The preparations for both the interment of the King’s body called ukutshala or “planting” of his remains and the memorial service on Thursday are under way. Service providers have started erecting marques at the same palace where a memorial service will be held on Thursday. It is expected that a procession will fetch the King’s body at midday on Wednesday. At midnight, the King’s body will then leave KwaKhethomthandayo Palace and be taken to eMahhashini Royal Burial Site in KwaZulu-Natal, where the body will be interred in a private ceremony attended by a select few male members of the royal family. The Spokesperson for the King, Prince Thulani Zulu says regiments (Amabutho) will be part of the procession from the mortuary and the planting of the King. “Amabutho (Zulu regiments) will be carrying the King right up to the palace because they have an important role. In fact, when it comes to the funeral, although it is [a] secrete, but Amabutho form part of the funeral of the majesty, everything is performed by Amabutho,” adds Zulu. Watch the live stream below:
