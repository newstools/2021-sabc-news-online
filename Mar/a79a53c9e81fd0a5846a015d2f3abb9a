South Africa commemorates Human Rights Day on 21 March every year. The day is meant to remind South Africans of the rights and freedom entitled to them. The day is also to pay homage to all of those who fought and lost their lives in the struggle for freedom (Sharpeville massacre of 1960.) The South Africa government states that: “Human Rights Day in South Africa is historically linked with 21 March 1960, and the events of Sharpeville. On that day 69 people died and 180 were wounded when police fired on a peaceful crowd that had gathered in protest against the Pass laws.” South Africa, now a democratic country, experienced many years of apartheid which saw the oppression of millions of people. The day is also used to celebrate democracy and the rights that are entitled to all South Africans despite their race.
