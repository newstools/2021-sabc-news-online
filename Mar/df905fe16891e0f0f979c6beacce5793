A child rapist has been sentenced to life imprisonment in the Pinetown Regional Court, west of Durban.  The 47-year-old Bafana Mkhize from Molweni was convicted for the rape of a 6-year-old child in January 2018. It’s alleged that Mkhize pulled the child into his house and raped her. The court has heard that he told the child not to report the incident to anyone. The child, who also lived in the same neighbourhood as Mkhize, told her mother and they reported the matter to the police. The child then pointed out the man to the police and he was arrested. The regional court prosecutor Zibuyile Zuma led the testimonies of the child, her mother, her aunt and a medical doctor. Because the child is young, anatomical dolls were used to assist her in testifying. Mkhize was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape.
