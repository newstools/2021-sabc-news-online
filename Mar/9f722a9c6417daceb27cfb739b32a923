A strong police contingent had to be deployed at Thabo Mofutsanyane district Municipality in QwaQwa, Free State after angry community members protested at the entrance of the municipality before Deputy President David Mabuza’s visit. Mabuza is on an oversight visit on service delivery in the area. He met with stakeholders to discuss solutions to the water crisis, electricity and service delivery challenges besieging the area. Dineo Moabi says they are against the hiring of outsiders to work on projects in QwaQwa and poor administration in the Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality. “This municipality is doing nothing for the community. At my age living such a life. It is so bad I regret why I grew old. This government is not treating us well. They are here because they want our votes. We want to talk to the deputy so that we tell him how we feel because we are the voice of the voiceless that municipality has fallen down Maluti-A-Phofung down with Maluti-A-Phofung down,” says the 67-year-old Moabi. Government officials visit the troubled Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality:  Yesterday,  opposition parties and provincial ANC leaders crossed swords in the municipality ahead of the visit of the top government officials. Opposition parties slammed the visit as political stunt, ahead of this year’s local government elections. ANC leaders, however, rejected the assertions as false, saying the organisation is concerned about the living conditions of ordinary South Africans.
