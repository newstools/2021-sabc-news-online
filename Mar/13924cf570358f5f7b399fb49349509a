Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize, says he is confident that the rollout of the country’s vaccine programme is still on track. This despite the department not meeting its target of vaccinating 1.5 million health workers by the end of April. Mkhize appeared before Parliament’s Health committee to give a two weekly briefing on the progress of the country’s COVID-19 vaccination programme. Currently a target of having 600 000 health workers vaccinated by the end of May, has been set. Mkhize says this is still in line with the first of a three-phase rollout plan. “Although we could’ve done more by now, we are still not past three months allocated for first phase. First phase allocated that because we know vaccines limited in first quarter and that was reason we gave it three months. Starting from February to the other end of April if you look at the dates,” he says. Minister Mkhize’s update on the J&J clinical trials and rollout:
