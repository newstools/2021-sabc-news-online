The East London Magistrate’s Court has set a trial date for Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and co-accused Adriaan Snyman. The trial will take place from August 23-27. Malema and Snyman are facing charges of unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful possession of ammunition and three counts of contravening the Firearms Control Act. Snyman faces only one count of contravening the Firearms Control Act. This is in relation to Malema’s alleged discharging of a rifle at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane in 2018,  during the EFF’s fifth birthday anniversary celebrations. National Prosecuting Authority Spokesperson Anelisa Ngcakani says they have a strong case against the accused. “The state is ready to proceed with its case. The investigation of the case is finalised and we are ready to proceed to trial, we are confident of our case,” says Ngcakani. Following the incident, Minority rights group AfriForum laid new criminal charges against Malema, as outlined in the video below:
