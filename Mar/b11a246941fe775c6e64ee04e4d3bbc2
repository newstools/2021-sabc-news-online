Western Cape Community Safety Minister, Albert Fritz, is expected to visit Mitchells Plain on Monday morning – an area that has been rocked by gang-related violence – claiming the lives of at least six people since last Thursday. Four others sustained gunshot wounds. Fritz says gangsters have declared war on the state. He has deployed 50 officers from the province’s crime-fighting programme called “Leap” to the area. They are paying particular attention to Beacon Valley and Tafelsig. Fritz has also called on the South African Police Service (SAPS) to beef up resources to put an end to the killing spree in the Western Cape. On Sunday, two police officers were killed while on duty in Bloekombos. The members were on patrol at Phumla Street when their vehicle came under fire in an apparent ambush.

Police are urging anyone who might have information that could assist their investigations to contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111 or send tip-offs on the MySAPS App. Two police officers gunned down in Cape Town:  #sapsWC Acting Provincial Commissioner institutes 72-hour activation plan & mobilizes various police units to apprehend those responsible for the killing of 2 Kraaifontein #SAPS members this earlier this morning in Bloekombos. #PoliceKillings #CrimeStop MEhttps://t.co/8Ku7UA68pB pic.twitter.com/87kV9eJgHU — SA Police Service  (@SAPoliceService) February 28, 2021  Police Minister Bheki Cele has slammed the attack on police officers, urging them to use maximum force when they are confronted by dangerous criminals.
