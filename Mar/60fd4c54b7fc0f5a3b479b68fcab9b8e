The National Prosecuting Authority has withdrawn all charges against Norma Gigaba, born Mngoma. The estranged wife of former minister, Malusi Gigaba, appeared at the Hatfield Magistrate Court in Pretoria to face charges of malicious damage to property and crimen injuria. She allegedly damaged a car her estranged husband had been using after borrowing it from a friend. A Pretoria high court last month declared that her arrest was unlawful and an abuse of power by members of the Hawks and her husband. Mngoma says it has been a long journey. “It has been a very emotional journey, I don’t want to lie. Although I have the very best legal team who stood by me, I still need to be a mother. Regardless, I had to appear in court, prepare for court and face the public. Twitter and everyone was saying things about me and people don’t know what happened. What happened is not what has been said. Whoever opened the case is the one who propagated the whole thing and the truth will come out,” she says. She is overjoyed:  “I am so happy, actually like I am very very excited because it’s been a long journey. Like few months, I think it’s eight months right now going through this process which is what’s unfair and planned to make me, to humiliate me and to destroy me. I think my image and everything,” she says. Her lawyer, Eric Mabuza, says they will be bringing a civil lawsuit against the state. “For all the humiliation…the trauma; the unlawful detention. For all those things as well as her reputation which has been tainted by this unlawful arrests,” he says. “Her family life has been affected. Her children have been affected. It is unimaginable what she has gone through, facing the full might of the state but we are pleased that she stood resolute and firm and calm and now she can rebuild her life. We are finalising the court papers to sue so that she can get her dignity and the state must pay for what they have done to her,” adds Mabuza.
