The extradition hearing of Enlightened Christian Gathering Church Pastor Shepherd Bushiri and his wife, Mary, is expected to begin in Malawi on Monday. South Africa has applied to have the fugitive couple brought back to the country to face fraud and money laundering charges. A warrant of arrest was issued after the Bushiris fled South Africa in contravention of their bail conditions. At the time, the self-proclaimed prophet claimed that they fled due to concerns over their safety. The fugitive couple last appeared at the Lilongwe Magistrate Court in January. Malawiâ€™s Director of Public Prosecutions, Steven Kayuni, told the court that the extradition request from South Africa has been formally served and includes charges of theft, fraud, forgery and failing to comply with bail conditions. Kayuni also says three additional counts of rape have been added to the charges against Shepherd Bushiri. Reports say the Malawi court has ruled that the couple not be re-arrested pending their re-appearance in court. The Bushiri saga is unpacked in the video below:
