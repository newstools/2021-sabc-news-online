Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi, says he is reviewing a report after his team investigated an incident in which a teacher was seen running a comb through a learner’s hair, in a video that is doing the rounds on social media. In the video, the teacher is believed to have made other learners line up to have their hair combed. Lesufi earlier took to social media, describing the educator’s conduct as unacceptable. Several other social media users, however, have described the teacher’s actions as a manner in which the school can ensure the dress code is adhered to. This is completely unacceptable .

They have just handed me a report. I am going through the report now. In this matter, we want to know whether the parents were involved and what was their response and whether the learner was warned before and what was the response of the learner.” It’s the indignity of standing at school gates, violently combing kinds’ hair! Why not write to their parents? Why not ask kids to do it themselves in a private space? In anyway, why the hell must they comb? Will it make them more teachable? Why humiliate them because of HAIR?? https://t.co/RIfgcGwdiv — Mbuyiseni Ndlozi (@MbuyiseniNdlozi) March 22, 2021
