Social Development Minister, Lindiwe Zulu, says over R84 000 needs to be recouped from the 241 government employees who illegally applied for and received the R350 COVID-19 relief grant. She was speaking the SABC following DA’s claims about government employees stealing from the state coffers. The opposition party urged for a speedy conclusion of the investigation into the matter. It says while the crime was committed in May last year, no action has yet been taken against the suspected employees. Zulu says her department needs to follow up on the progress of other government departments, in their legal and disciplinary action against the employees. “There was 241 out of the 40 000 that applied, which means that we have to get back R84 350. We cannot take action against them as they are not employed under the department of social development or SASSA, they are in other departments. Treasury then, in asserting that, we wrote letters to the different departments to say these are the people that are supposed to have applied and the action has to be taken by the departments. But of course, we need to follow it up,” explains the Minister. More on this story in the video below:
