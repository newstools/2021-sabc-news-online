Justice and Correctional Services Ronald Lamola says resources will be found to ensure that the State Capture Commission concludes its work. He says they are currently engaging National Treasury and the Commission to ensure that it finalises its mandate. About  R800 million has already been spent on the commission which was expected to conclude its work by March and this has now been extended to June. Lamola was answering questions during a Ministerial Peace and Security Cluster oral reply session in the National Assembly. “There are, indeed, challenges with regard to the budget of the Commission because we did not anticipate that it is going to handle issues of this magnitude which are going to be broadened and which are going to be complex. But we are now here. We have to respond to the present challenges that the Commission is confronting. Hence, we are in discussion with the secretary of the commission – with the director general of the Department of Justice and the National Treasury to find a solution to enable the Commission to conclude its work. What we can assure the people of South Africa is that the Commission will conclude its work and we will find resources to ensure that the Commission concludes its work .” Steinhoff saga Meanwhile, Minister Lamola maintains that investigations into accounting fraud at the embattled furniture retailer group Steinhoff remain a priority. This as German prosecutors are set to announce charges against former Steinhoff executives on Thursday. The Steinhoff saga remains one of the biggest fraud cases in the country’s history. And there have been no charges or arrests. The company’s alleged fraud and accounting irregularities wiped out over R200 billion in the furniture group in 2017. The Justice Minister says the Financial Sector Conduct Authority investigations into insider trading have been finalised. And a case docket into insider trading against suspects has been registered with the Hawks.
