[WARNING: The following story might upset some readers and children.] The murder trial of a 52-year-old man, who allegedly killed his four children, is expected to resume at the Polokwane High Court in Limpopo on Thursday. Lucas Phasha allegedly killed his children aged three, five, seven and nine, at their home at Ga-Phasha, outside Burgersfort in February last year. It is alleged that the older three children were hacked with an axe, while the youngest was bludgeoned with a stone. Phasha was out on parole for another murder charge when the killings occurred. Lucas Phasha’s nephew, Raymond, who spent most of the day with Phasha after the children’s bodies were discovered will continue giving evidence. Raymond has thus far testified that Phasha told him that he killed the four children because his wife – the deceased children’s mother – was unable to properly care for them. Raymond says his uncle raised complaints that his wife was never at home and left the children dirty and unfed. The defense is expected to start cross-examining Raymond.
