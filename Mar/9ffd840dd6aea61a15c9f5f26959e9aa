Three suspects that were separately found in possession of suspected Ivermectin tablets at the OR Tambo International Airport in January will appear in the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday morning. Currently in South Africa, health practitioners are allowed to prescribe the drug under Section 21 authorisation of the Medicines and Related Substances Act. However, the drug is not registered for human use in the country. Some health practitioners have been calling for the use of Ivermectin to treat coronavirus:  The suspects were previously granted bail of R50 000. All three were found to be transporting large amounts of the drug to be sold on the black market in South Africa as treatment for COVID-19. The suspects have handed over their passports to authorities in South Africa. South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (Sahpra) has stepped up efforts to clamp down on illegal drugs and are working with South African Revenue Service (SARS) customs officials and the police to stop it from entering the country.
