The National Executive Committee of the African National Congress (ANC) is scheduled to convene a special meeting this weekend over a scathing letter by CoGTA Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to Secretary General, Ace Magashule, complaining about Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula. The NEC is expected to address the matter as well as ongoing student protests at Institutions of higher learning across the country. Mbalula took to twitter and accused fellow NEC member, Dlamini-Zuma, of gunning for the top job in the ANC just to create a family dynasty in the ANC. This angered the CoGTA minister and she then ordered that, this must be dealt with by the ANC top six officials and the NEC. It remains to be seen, what form of action the ANC NEC will take against Mbalula on the latest developments on social media. Mbalula has since apologised to the CoGTA Minister for his utterances.
