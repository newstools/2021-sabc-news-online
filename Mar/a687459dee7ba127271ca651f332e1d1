The business community is remembering the late AmaZulu King, Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu’s, contribution to economic development in KwaZulu-Natal. The 72-year-old monarch died in a Durban hospital on Friday from COVID-19 related complications. Durban businessman, Vivian Reddy, says the stature and respect that the King commanded attracted investors to the province. “He was a person who wasn’t a King of the Zulu nation, he was a King for everyone. He was a people’s King, and I believe we have lost a King of kings. One of the greatest believers of recent history in South Africa.” “If you go back and look at what he has done and where did he come from, then you would really appreciate what he has done. The economic investment was very important to him, and I have been very fortunate that I travelled with him overseas on a few occasions where he went out there to get investments,” explains Reddy. A look at AmaZulu King Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu’s reign:  On Monday, hostel dwellers in Durban said they have suspended all activities this week to mourn the passing of the AmaZulu King. Hostels accommodate large numbers of people from the rural areas, who find employment in places like Durban. Hundreds of workers, originally from far-flung rural areas, live at Dalton hostel.
