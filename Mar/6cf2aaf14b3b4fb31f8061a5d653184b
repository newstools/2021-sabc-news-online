Brian Molefe returns to the State Capture Commission sitting in Johannesburg on Monday. However, this time he will be testifying about his tenure at Transnet. Molefe worked as a group CEO at Transnet from 2011 to 2015, after which he joined Eskom. Last week, he was in the hot seat in his capacity as former Eskom CEO at the commission that’s probing allegations of the capture of the country’s state-owned entities. Molefe denied having knowledge of former president Jacob Zuma nor that of the Gupta family’s plans to appoint him as the Finance Minister in 2015. A number of witnesses had told the commission that he had been earmarked for the position. Molefe said he was an educated and experienced executive and didn’t need help from anyone to advance in his career:  He also rejected claims that he might have influenced a decision for Gupta-owned company, Tegeta, to receive a R1.6 billion pre-payment for the supply of coal to Eskom’s Hendrina Power Station. Molefe also implicated the President in his testimony, saying Glencore relied on its association with him in its dealings with Eskom. President Cyril Ramaphosa was Zuma’s deputy at the time. His office has said he will wait until Molefe has completed his testimony to respond to the claims.
