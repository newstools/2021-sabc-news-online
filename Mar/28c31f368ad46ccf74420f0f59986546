Political analyst professor Mcebisi Ndletyana says the latest development in the African National Congress (ANC) will help to restore the credibility of the governing party. He was reacting to a resolution of the party’s NEC weekend meeting that party members facing criminal charges should step down in line with the ANC’s step-aside resolution. Members facing criminal charges include party Secretary-General Ace Magashule. Other members are Member of Parliament Bongani Bhongo, KwaZulu-Natal Deputy Chairperson Micheal Mabuyakhulu, former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede and Limpopo Treasurer Danny Msiza. Ndletyana says this bodes well for the ANC. “It’s actually good for the NEC as a whole because as you know quite a number [of members] were reluctant to act against corruption, because some of them are somewhat implicated in this. But finally, it looks like the majority of them are rallying behind the President. So this is good for the ANC because it then means you are likely to have one united voice on a number of issues. It is also a bit reassuring to the public because [they] were worried that the President doesn’t seem to be in charge of his own party,” says Ndletyana.

The concerned members were apparently given seven days to step aside or face suspension. Those who are against the resolution are said to have led to the breakdown of the meeting, interrupting President Ramaphosa when speaking.
