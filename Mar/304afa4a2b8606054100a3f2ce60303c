The family of  Senzo Meyiwa says it had hoped the identity of the mastermind behind the killing of the late Bafana Bafana captain, would be revealed in court on Friday. Five men implicated in the soccer star’s murder appeared in the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court in Johannesburg earlier. Their case was transferred to the high court and postponed to October 25 for trial. They face charges of murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances, attempted murder and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. The family’s spokesperson, Siya Meyiwa, says it hopes the alleged mastermind will be arrested soon. “We were under the impression that key individuals, based on the theory that it was a planned murder, that the person who was sponsoring the whole thing would be appearing as well. So, we were expecting that, but we are greatly disappointed that none of them showed up,” says Meyiwa. Gerrie Nel disappointed that the mastermind has not been arrested:  The former Bafana Bafana and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper was shot dead at the home of his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo in Voslroorus, in Ekurhuleni, in 2014.
