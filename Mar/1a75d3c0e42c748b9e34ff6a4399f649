African National Congress (ANC) members protested outside eNCA offices on Tuesday over the treatment of Members of Parliament by one of the organisation’s journalist. The ANC says it will submit a formal complaint to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa and the Human Rights Commission regarding the conduct of eNCA reporter, Lindsay Dentlinger. Dentlinger raised the ire of South Africans when she interviewed white MPs without their masks on while she asked their black counterparts to keep theirs on. The ANC’s Jessie Duarte has asked eNCA to take Dentlinger to the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) for training. The eNCA’s Norman Nenzhelele received the ANC’s memorandum at the company’s Hyde Park headquarters, in Johannesburg. He said the company will be holding workshops with its staff members in a bid to avoid incidents like the mask debacle in the future. Dentlinger has acknowledged the outrage and disrespect felt by some members of South African society. She says it was an oversight on her part not to ask the Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Mulder to wear a mask as he was her first interview subject after the Finance Minister’s budget speech. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says, “Both Dentliger and eNCA have wronged our nation and undermined our collective efforts of building a nation on the values of equality and non-racialism.” List of demands by ANC: Gauteng ANC stages a protest at the eNCA headquarters over racism allegations:
