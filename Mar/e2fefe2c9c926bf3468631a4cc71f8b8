 Earlier political analyst, Kagiso Pooe, said there’s strong evidence that the ANC has lost its vision. Pooe said the reported instability and factional battles in the ANC are nothing new. “One might argue this is just the norm of the ANC. It represents what has been happening over the last 10 years. I just make reference to the two previous Secretary-Generals Reports which actually paint a picture of a party which certainly doesn’t have a vision for the country, let alone a vision for how it should conduct itself and conduct its leadership. We should not think this is something wholly new. We should rather understand it in the context of this (as) a party in disarray without a vision for the country and also for itself,” he said.
