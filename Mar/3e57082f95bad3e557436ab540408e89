Princess Thembi Ndlovu, the sister of the late AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, says no successor has been chosen yet to be installed as the new Zulu monarch. Princess Thembi was speaking at the memorial service of AmaZulu King in KwaNongoma in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday. She says King Goodwill Zwelithini had many children but nobody among the royal family knows who will ascend the throne. She says when King Goodwill Zwelithini’s father, King Cyprian Bhekuzulu died in 1968, he did not know that he would be the successor.  ‘Repository of culture and tradition’ Speaking at the Special Official Memorial of the King in Kwa-Nongoma, President Cyril Ramaphosa says the late Amazulu King was the repository of culture and tradition. Ramaphosa says through his commitment to cultural activities, he managed to turn his province into a tourism mecca of South Africa.
