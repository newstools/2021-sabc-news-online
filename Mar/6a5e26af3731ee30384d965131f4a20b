The ANC in Parliament is yet to comment on reports that Luthuli House has instructed the party’s Members of Parliament not to vote with the opposition in the envisaged inquiry into the Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. The latest developments follow Parliament’s establishment of an independent panel that has found prima facie evidence of incompetence and misconduct on the part of Mkhwebane. The National Assembly has since announced that it will decide before the end of this month on whether to proceed with the impeachment process against Mkhwebane. ANC Women’s League last week issued a statement calling for its members not to vote with those who are against the removal of the Public Protector from office. Last week, Mkhwebane said she’s confident she will be cleared of any wrongdoing. Her spokesperson Oupa Segalwe spoke to Morning Live about the matter:  Former Constitutional Court Justice, Johann Kriegler, says he strongly believes Parliament should act against  Mkhwebane. Kriegler says, “Independent panel acting in terms of the rules of Parliament has produced a report. I have seen their recommendations, they are perfectly clear. The Portfolio Committee should now take the matter to the floor of the house with a motion for the impeachment for the dismissal of Advocate Mkhwebane.”  The DA has also called on Parliament to immediately start proceedings against Mkhwebane.
