The Sol Plaatje Municipality in the Northern Cape says the law must take its course after nine people – including five former employees – were arrested on 92 counts of fraud and money laundering amounting to at least R1.6 million. It is alleged that the suspects either received or disseminated money from the municipality as part of a ghost workers scam. The nine were released on bail between R1000 and R2000 following an appearance in the Kimberley Magistrate’s Court. Municipal spokesperson, Sello Matsie, says the arrests come after the municipality investigated the allegations internally and fired five of the suspects. “We have always made it very clear that any wrongful or criminal conduct will not be tolerated and continue to call on all our employees and the general public to report such activities to the police. We believe the law should take its course and justice should prevail. As a public institution and local government for that matter, criminal activity is absolutely forbidden.”
