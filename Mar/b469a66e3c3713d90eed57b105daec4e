Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula says she hopes that a report into sexual misconduct and exploitation within the South African National Defence Force (Sandf) will finally bring an end to sexual abuse in the force. The Ministerial Task Team, which looked into the reporting, management, and finalisation of sexual harassment and sexual abuse cases in the force,  finally handed over the report to the Minister after its appointment in late 2019. The report follows numerous complaints of sexual abuse and exploitation in the force over the years, the report, which is yet to be publicised by the Minister, found penalties imposed on perpetrators were insufficient and that the environment was not victim friendly. Mapisa-Nqakula says she has been receiving complaints from female members of the Sandf over allegations of sexual misconduct and exploitation. Sexual misconduct cases in the military have spiked, and little has been done internally to address the issue. The report flagged the Sandf due to rape cases reported in areas of deployment, mostly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The report also found some members also fathered and left children in the DRC. Some female members who are victims of abuse have been left depressed over the slow wheels of justice and a slap on the wrist for perpetrators.
