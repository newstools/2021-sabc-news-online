The Economic Freedom Fighters Student Command at the University of Pretoria is calling for the postponement of the 2021 academic year. They say this should happen as the students intensify their contemplated shut down of universities to allow all first year students to register. Students want the institution to register those with historical debts with immediate effect. This emerged at gatherings attended by EFF Students Command leaders and supporters outside the entrance of the University of Pretoria on Monday night. Metro police were deployed to monitor the situation. The group’s spokesperson Pholoso Sehlelane says they are giving the university 24 hours to adhere to their demands. “So, what we are doing now … we are drafting the memorandum. Every student here is making an input on what must happen. So in that memorandum tomorrow [Tuesday] we will require the Vice-chancellor to come and receive that.” “[On] Wednesday we [are] giving him 24hrs to respond to that. Because classes have started online and students have gathered here so that the university can hear their demands. And the hashtag that we will be using is #UPVula, #UPAsinaMali, those are the hashtags that we will be using both on social and in classes,” explains Sehlelane. Several universities and colleges across the country had no lectures on Monday and at least one institution, the University of KwaZulu-Natal, has suspend lectures for the rest of the week. On Monday afternoon, a female student was admitted to hospital after she was shot and wounded in the leg allegedly by police firing live ammunition during protests that have intensified in Johannesburg. Several students have also been arrested. GRAPHIC CONTENT : More arrests made in Braamfontein, one student shot
