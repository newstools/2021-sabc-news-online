President Cyril Ramaphosa has signed a proclamation authorising the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) to investigate allegations of corruption, malpractice and maladministration in the North West Department of Public Works and Roads. The proclamation authorises the SIU to investigate transactions that took place between January 2016 and March 2021. SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago says their scope of work is to also recover any financial losses suffered by the department. “We are looking at the procurement process that happened in the department in relation to project management for the transport infrastructure directorate of the department. We are also looking at the procurement of the rehabilitation of flood damage to road infrastructure. We are also looking at the procurement that was done in the installation of the parameter fence at the Eagle Water Wild Life Resort,” explains Kganyago. Meanwhile, in February, North West Premier Job Mokgoro said his administration will establish a provincial forensic investigation unit to probe allegations of fraud, corruption, and maladministration within government departments and municipalities. Premier Mokgoro made the announcement during his State of the Province Address: He said the investigation will come into effect in April.
