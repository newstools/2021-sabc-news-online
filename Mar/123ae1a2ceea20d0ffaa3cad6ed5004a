Western Cape Minister of Community Safety, Albert Fritz, says the provincial government will do whatever it takes to make the province safer for all. Fritz presented the Department of Community Safety’s budget for the 2021/22 financial year. He says the department has gone beyond its Constitutional mandate to bring the Western Cape Safety Plan into fruition. Fritz’s spokesperson Cayla Murray says the provincial government plans to halve the murder rate in the next 10 years. Murray says R2.35 billion has been set aside for the safety of residents over the medium term. “Having transferred most of the operational and start-up capital costs for the Law Enforcement Advancement Plan (LEAP) programme to the City of Cape Town, the Department’s budget allocation has decreased for the 2021/22 financial year by 5.79%. This brings our total budget to R739.049 million for the 2021/22 financial year. Make no mistake, our next tranche of LEAP officers is on the way.”
