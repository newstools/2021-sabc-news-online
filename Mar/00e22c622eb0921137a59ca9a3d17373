The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in Vryburg in the North West says it is delighted by the outcome of the municipal council meeting of the Dr Ruth Mompati District Municipality, which sent its Executive Mayor Boitumelo Mahlangu packing. The council removed Mahlangu in a vote of no confidence. The ANCYL says council has implemented the long overdue decision of the Interim Provincial Committee by removing Mahlangu. They say Mahlangu has been a defiant mayor who refused the call of the ANC to step down for the collapse of the municipality under her watch. ANC regional secretary, Crespo Menyatso, congratulated the newly appointed Executive Mayor Kgalalelo Sereko. “The former Mayor Boitumelo Mahlangu defied the African National Congress and unfortunately continued to plug the municipality into a deeper crisis. Since 2016 under her mayorship, the municipal audit opinion has regressed drastically and the municipality has been involved in many scandals, such as R150 million that is actually lost to VBS. More than R1 billion irregular expenditure and advance payment of 16 million to some of the service providers.” Political analyst, Andre Duvenage has commended the Dr Ruth Segomotsi Mompati District council for taking a stand. “The decision to take out one of the mayors in North West is a decision in the right direction. It has support of the ANC although it’s the Youth League. We can expect some tension on certain levels. It is good to see the ANC in a way acting in line with the constitution in terms of their own strategic point of action against corruption. It is an indication to me that the conflict within the ANC may go the direction of the constitutionalists, I’m talking about Mr Job Mokgoro and on national level the Cyril Ramaphosa group. We can expect some reaction, some push back from other lines and opposition groups.”
