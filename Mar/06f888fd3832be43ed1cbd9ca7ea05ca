A group of people dressed in the colours of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) of Azania has disrupted Human Rights Day commemorations during which Gauteng Premier David Makhura was supposed to lay wreaths at the Phelindaba cemetery in Sharpeville on the Vaal. They claim that they are not included in the programme to honour the struggle heroes. Makhura is scheduled to pay tribute to the victims of the massacre during which 69 people were killed on March 21, 1960, while protesting against the apartheid government’s human rights abuses. The programme has been delayed as the group continued singing struggle songs to disrupt the start of the proceedings. The PAC members who are clad in black and gold T-shirts had their own programme planned, using the same platform that was prepared for Makhura. The PAC members then decided to continue with their programme and allow the Premier to continue with his programme after they were done. Makhura will deliver a keynote address at the Vereeniging City Hall. It is our duty as a nation to strive for inclusive socio-economic development, while ensuring that we combat discriminations such as racism, xenophobia, homophobia, as well as gender-based violence and femicide, which continue to undermine our human rights culture #HumanRightsDay pic.twitter.com/VCihO7684i — David Makhura (@David_Makhura) March 21, 2021  Wreath laying ceremony by Premier @David_Makhura and MEC’s @MbaliHlopheSA and @JacobMamaboloSA at the Pelindaba Cemetery #HumanRightsDay pic.twitter.com/JiClcZsrGw — GautengGov (@GautengProvince) March 21, 2021  South Africa commemorates Human Rights Day:
