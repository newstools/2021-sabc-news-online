He was speaking in a live address to the nation during which he announced that the country had entered alert level one of the lockdown. The President says the country has secured vaccines from different manufacturers to ensure herd immunity. Government aims to vaccinate over 40 million people before the end of 2021. It has so far vaccinated over 67 000 healthcare workers in phase one of the nationwide programme.

Of these doses, 2.8 million doses will be delivered in the second quarter and the rest spread throughout the year. We have also secured 20 million doses from Pfizer, which will be delivered from the second quarter.
