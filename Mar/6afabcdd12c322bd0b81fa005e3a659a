The Democratic Alliance Limpopo elective congress scheduled for this weekend has been cancelled after allegations of fraud and tax evasion against current leader, Jacques Smalle, who is also one of the candidates. The party’s federal executive says the allegations that are being investigated have implications on a free and fair elective conference. Smalle allegedly avoided paying tax by diverting his travel allowances to be paid to his aides instead of being paid into his bank account. Smalle, who has been the DA leader in the province since 2012, was contesting the position with DA MP Solly Malatsi. Party spokesperson Siviwe Gwarube says an administrator has been appointed as the term of office of the current leadership ends this weekend. “The DA federal executive acting on the advice of the presiding officers of the Limpopo congress that has resolved to cancel the congress until the information which has emerged and the allegations which have been levelled are adequately investigated by the federal legal commission due to the fact that the term of the current leadership is set to lapse on Saturday the 20th of March. The federal executive has appointed an administrator to manage the affairs of the province until a new congress is convened and a new leadership team is elected.’
