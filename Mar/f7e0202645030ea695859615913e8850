The mayor of Nongoma Albert Mncwango has announced that the municipality will erect public viewing screens to accommodate community members who will not be able to attend the memorial service of the late AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu on Thursday. The Zulu monarch passed on last Friday from COVID-19 complications. His funeral will be a private ceremony attended by a select few male members of the royal family. It is believed that the ceremony will be performed in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Buthelezi said the monarch will be “planted” in accordance with all customs and traditions befitting the King. According to the royal family, regiments called amabutho will be part of the planting ceremony on Wednesday night.  Lockdown regulations Mncwango says, “It’s an attempt to try to avert congestion of people which violates the lockdown regulations. We as the municipality have identified certain spots in towns where we are going to be putting up big screens for people to follow the proceedings.” “That will be taking place here on Thursday. We have identified for now three locations where we are going to be putting up screens. One is at the multi-purpose hall and two screens are going to be put up at the taxi rank,” adds Mncwango.
