Former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede’s supporters have started arriving at the Durban Magistrate’s court. Gumede and 21 others, including City Manager Sipho Nzuza, are due in court on charges of fraud and corruption. Some of Gumede’s supporters are coming from outside the province, even as far as the Free State. The group coming from ANC’s Fezile Dabi region says they believe in Gumede’s innocence. Outside the court, a marquee and a stage are being set up where Gumede might address her supporters after her appearance. #sabcnews #sabckzn Outside the Durban Magistrate court, some of Zandile Gumede’s supporters have started arriving.
