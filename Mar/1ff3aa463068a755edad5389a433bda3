The Mpumalanga Education Department has instituted an investigation into allegations of maladministration and misappropriation of school funds at Zinikeleni Secondary School in Carolina. Two senior officials at the school will be facing internal disciplinary hearings over allegations that they colluded with some School Governing Body (SGB) members in misusing funds which led to the school failing to pay its creditors. The school also failed to submit its financial statement to auditors as per requirements. Mpumalanga’s Education spokesperson Jasper Zwane says, “We are currently engaging the SGB to come forward so that the process can be fast-tracked. We have also requested the circuit manager to ensure that there is stability so that teaching and learning are not compromised.” “We are monitoring the situation very closely and we are pleading to all role players to cooperate with the department so that at the end of the day we work in the best interest of the learners,” added Zwane.
