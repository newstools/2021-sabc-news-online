The 35-year-old was killed on Wednesday during a protest by Wits University students. Ntumba had just visited a local clinic when police allegedly shot him dead. He died on the scene from bullet wounds. Cele paid the family a visit following Ntumba’s death but denies having any discussions about funeral arrangements with them. Police Ministry Spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, says Cele assured the bereaved family that police would cooperate fully with IPID’s investigations into the death of their son.  Four police officers arrested The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) has arrested four police officers from the Public Order Policing Unit in connection with the death of Ntumba. The four officers will appear at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday facing charges of murder, attempted murder and defeating the ends of justice.
