South African television actor Menzi Ngubane has passed away. He was 56-years-old. Ngubane is best known for his role as Sibusiso Dlomo on SABC 1’s soapie Generations and most recently as Judas Ngwenya on Mzansi Magic’s Isibaya. Ngubane has also played numerous roles on other South African TV shows, including Kwakhala Nyonini, Yizo Yizo, Ashes to Ashes, Gold Diggers, and Heist. The actor suffered a kidney failure in 2015 and was thrown a lifeline after a generous South African donated one for him. However, it seems the problem persisted as last year, it was reported on social media that he had been admitted in hospital for a recurring kidney problem.
