The province reported its first case two weeks later. The pandemic has brought devastation, causing loss of lives. One year since the first positive COVID-19 case was diagnosed in SA:  The province also welcomed expatriates from Wuhan, China. They were quarantined in Polokwane. This instilled fear and anxiety among people. The pandemic brought its toll amongst the frontline workers. Exhaustion, depression and anxiety had set in. The authorities had worst fears. Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers:  Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba says it has been a difficult period. “It has been a tough and a long journey coming from welcoming people from Wuhan till today. As we speak as a province, when we reflect, our cumulative cases are over 61 000, which is above the 1% rate. We had anticipated between 2% and 5% in a worst scenario. We said we will have between 5% and 10%, so we have not even reached the 2%.” SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 330 226 194 053 62 257 71 641 11 314 1 917 1 274 DEATHS 3 352 11 260 9 813 9 723 1 203 710 86163 406 198 61 340 34 260 278 509  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape 80 495 5 MARCH 2021 1 518 979 50 566 9 207 347 1 437 050 1 313 104 Vaccination Rollout 100 180 Healthcare workers vaccinated (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Vaccination The health workers have also remembered their colleagues who have lost their lives due to the pandemic.
