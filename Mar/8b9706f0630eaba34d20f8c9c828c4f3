Tembe says Tyawa must be placed on precautionary suspension pending the outcome of an investigation for bringing the name of parliament into disrepute. “We are talking about somebody here that earns R3.2 million. The person that recently refused to pay performance bonuses to the employees pleading poverty. If she can’t afford the rental fee of R16 000 per month, how does she expect ordinary employees to afford the rental fees and the bonds that they have in Cape Town? Therefore, we are saying that parliament must be consistent. Presiding Officers must put her on precautionary suspension pending an investigation. Her conduct brought the name of parliament into disrepute.”
