Former Lily Mine employees and residents of Low’s Creek near Barberton are calling on the Mpumalanga High Court to set aside or fast-track the court case between owners of Vantage Goldfields, business rescue practitioners and the potential investor, Arqomanzi. The court granted Arqomanzi an interim order preventing the implementation of an amended rescue plan. The business rescue practitioners are accused of changing the business rescue plan without consulting them as major creditors.  Some of the former workers believe that should the court case be set aside, the new plan will be implemented and they will be paid monies owed to them by the mine. They believe that the court case is delaying the implementation of the new business rescue plan. The Lily Mine business rescue practitioners amended the business rescue plan in January. The plan was amended after mine owner, Vantage Goldfields, secured a financial deal with Australia-based company Macquarie Metals. One of the major creditors of the mine Arqomanzi accuses the practitioners of changing the plan without consulting them and took the matter to court. In February, Arqomanzi was granted an interim court order preventing the implementation of the amended rescue plan. Other interested parties were given until next month to oppose the issuing of a final court order. Some of the former workers believe that the court case should be set aside. They are calling for a new plan and for money owed to them to be paid back by the mine. They are also calling for the remains of the three workers who died at the mine in 2016 to be retrieved.
