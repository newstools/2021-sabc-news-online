Former president Jacob Zuma will no longer meet with the African National Congress (ANC) top six officials at Luthuli House in Johannesburg on Monday as previously expected. Instead, it is now likely to take place virtually. It, however, remains unclear whether that will happen today as scheduled or at a later date. The governing party leaders were today meant to deliberate on Zuma’s standoff with the Zondo Commission that’s probing claims of state capture that is said to have happened during the former president’s tenure at Mahlamba Ndlopfu. Zuma is facing a contempt of court charge after he defied a Constitutional Court order that he appears before the commission. The former president has, however, vowed not to appear before the commission if  Justice Zondo does not recuse himself. Zuma believes that there is a level of bias against him and a lack of impartiality. However, the commission has rejected these claims and has lodged an application with the Constitutional Court, requesting that the former president be jailed for two years for defying an order of the Apex Court. Today is the deadline for Zuma to file answering affidavits in the matter, which is scheduled to go to court later this month.
