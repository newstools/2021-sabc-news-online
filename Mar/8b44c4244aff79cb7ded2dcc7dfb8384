The murder trial of a 19-year-old who allegedly stabbed to death an 18-year-old at Seshego in Polokwane in January last year is expected to start at the Polokwane High Court in Limpopo today. Dimakatso Mochemi, who was aged 17 at the time, was allegedly part of a gang that was terrorising Seshego when he allegedly stabbed Thoriso Kgomo. Mochemi was out on bail for alleged rape when the incident happened.  Kgomo’s death led to residents going from house to house searching for gang members at the time. The trial was due to start yesterday but was postponed after Mochemi’s lawyer withdrew. Thoriso’s father, Lawrence Kgomo says they want justice to be served. “I think there were just some delaying tactics yesterday whereby the two lawyers from legal aid board, one was withdrawn and the other one came late citing reasons that he was lost around the building. We are still asking for justice so that this case goes on as being prepared.’
