The South African National Civic Organization (SANCO) in the Free State has lambasted billionaire businessman Johan Rupert for allegedly interfering in the affairs of the African National Congress (ANC). According to weekend reports, Rupert met with President Cyril Ramaphosa and instructed him to remove ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule or risk losing his financial support for the party. SANCO Free State spokesperson Gift Poli says Magashule is being persecuted for refusing to take instructions from what he calls white masters. Poli says Magashule is fighting for the implementation of radical economic transformation. “There are tensions within the ANC and the Secretary-General who is advancing radical economic transformation, who is ensuring that land is returned to our people, who is ensuring that there’s free education and all conference resolutions are implemented, is the target of this onslaught,” says Poli.
