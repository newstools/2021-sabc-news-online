The High Court in Pretoria is on Tuesday set to hear a case in which Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema is applying to unseal the CR17 bank statements. Malema is adamant that South Africans have the right to know who funded Cyril Ramaphosa’s ANC presidential campaign and whether his donors are benefitting from state contracts. However, Ramaphosa insists that he is willing to lay all his cards on the table when it comes to his CR17 campaign funding documents. In the video below, Ramaphosa’s lawyers say he never benefitted financially from CR17 campaign:  In August 2020, the President’s lawyers wrote to North Gauteng Deputy Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba asking him to seal part of the record that concerned information relating to the bank statements of the campaign. They said it reflected confidential third-party information and there was reason to believe that some of it may have been unlawfully obtained. The President was able to secure a court order that sealed the details of his donors, keeping them private for the foreseeable future. The hearing has been set down for Tuesday and Wednesday.
