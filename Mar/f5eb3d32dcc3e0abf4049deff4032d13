Former North West Premier Supra Mahumapelo has written to the chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Amos Masondo, requesting him to remove China Dodovu as chairperson for the Adhoc Committee on the Section 100 intervention into the North West. Section 100 entails the placement of the entire province under administration following what many said was widespread corruption. Dodovu was appointed to lead the committee established to review the intervention in the province and make necessary recommendations to Parliament. Mahumapelo believes Dodovu will not play an objective and unbiased role in the committee. “I have got in my possession video recordings where a businessman who was addressing a funeral [service] two weeks ago details the process which they followed, planned and executed to bring down Mahumapelo in the context of the Supra must fall campaign in the province and in Klerksdorp,” adds the the former premier. But Dodovu sees no problem with his appointment. “I am not going to honour that letter with a comment. I have not elected myself. It is the house that nominated me as one of the committee members. Committee members of different political parties have expressed confidence in my leadership. They elected me unopposed. I don’t want to be diverted I don’t want to be de-focussed in what I am doing,” says  Dodovu.
