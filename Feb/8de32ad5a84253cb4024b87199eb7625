KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Premier Sihle Zikalala says the country has lost an icon following the passing of former MEC for Agriculture and struggle stalwart Dr. Meshack Radebe. Zikalala has described Radebe as a political peacekeeper and a people’s person. Radebe played a critical role in stabilising relations between the ANC and the IFP in the province. Zikalala has expressed deep shock and sadness at the news of his passing. “As the government of KZN, we extend our heartfelt condolences to the family friends and all relatives; but also his political home the ANC. Comrade Meshack is known for working hard and establishing peace in various areas in KZN, especially around Hammersdale during the difficult time of violence. We are convinced that all of those who have learned from his leadership will emulate him and ensure that his legacy stands on.” The news of his passing was confirmed by family spokesperson Thembinkosi Radebe. Radebe described the late former MEC as a loving and supportive father to his family. “It’s not easy for the family and his children because just two days ago, they were hoping that he is going to recover and that he’s going to come back and return home but it didn’t happen so it was quite a shock. It was a disappointment, but we have to, as a family, just accept it and then move on. He will be missed by the family. He has done so much for the people of KZN and we are very saddened by this sudden loss.”
