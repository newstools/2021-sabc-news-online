Angry community members have stoned to death four people and torched their houses in Mutele B Village, outside Musina, in Limpopo. Police spokesperson, Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, says the violence was allegedly sparked by the disappearance of a local man last week. Police are searching for the suspects. “The Limpopo police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba has condemned this incident and has ordered a 72 hour activation plan be implemented to hunt down the killers. Four counts of murder have been opened and anyone with information is requested to call toll free number 08600 10111 or visit their nearest police station,” adds Mojapelo. Some people suspect that the man was killed for ritual purposes. Mojapelo says the police have been deployed to Mutele B village to quell the violence. In another incident, an angry mob stoned to death and set alight a 43-year-old man at Bismack Village, outside Tzaneen.
