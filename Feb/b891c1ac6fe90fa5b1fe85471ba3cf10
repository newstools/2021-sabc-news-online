The Eastern Cape Health Department says it is ready to roll out the COVID-19 vaccine and face challenges that may arise. The first batch of the vaccine is expected to be in the country on Monday. Eight storage facilities have already been set up and the provincial government is targeting to vaccinate 3.7 million people in six to nine months. The vaccine is expected to reach the Eastern Cape in about two to three weeks. Acting HOD in the Eastern Cape Health Department Dr Sibongile Zungu says, “Whilst we see challenges with the vastness of the province, we are ready to overcome those challenges having set up a plan for the rural areas working with district municipalities and local municipalities. We have plans right up to ward level to address the issues that we foresee.” Eastern Cape gears up to administer COVID-19 vaccine:  Over 500 vaccinators are currently being trained for the rollout. The vaccine will be a huge boost as the province has, on many occasions, recorded a high number of infections and deaths. Eastern Cape residents are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the COVID-19 vaccine and believe this will help get their lives back to normal.
