Motorists travelling on the N14 road between  Vryburg and Kuruman are warned to be careful when driving on the road because of the heavy downpours which make the road difficult to drive on. North West Traffic Management and Public Safety spokesperson Oshebeng Koonyaditse has advised that motorists should use alternative routes. “The downpours experienced since Wednesday night have led to flash floods. [The road is] partially opened this morning. Traffic officials have been sent there since last night.” “The road is now safe to drive on. But motorists are advised to drive carefully and adhere to the speed limit,” explains Koonyaditse.
