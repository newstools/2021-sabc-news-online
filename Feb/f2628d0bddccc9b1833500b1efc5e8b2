As the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines arrive on the continent there are still concerns about Africa’s level of preparedness for vaccine rollouts. COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access) has notified countries in Africa of the estimated dose allocation for the first phase of COVID-19 vaccine delivery. The global initiative led by the World Health Organisation and The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations aims to start shipping nearly 90 million vaccine doses to the continent in February. Dr. Phionah Atuhebwe, WHO Africa Regional Vaccines Introduction Officer, said that despite a few country’s having advanced vaccine rollout plans in place, Africa as a whole is only at a 43% level of preparedness for vaccine programmes. In the video below, Dr. Phionah Atuhebwe explains further on the vaccine rollout in Africa:   Meanwhile, the South African government will soon commence with its Vaccine Rollout Strategy after the country received its first consignment of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine from the Serum Institute of India last week. Half a million more vaccines are expected by the end of February. The vaccine will be made available to all people in three phases, beginning with frontline healthcare workers, followed by other essential workers and high-risk groups before the rollout is extended to the rest of the population.
