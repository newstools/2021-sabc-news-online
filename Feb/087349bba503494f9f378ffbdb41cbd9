Former Transport Minister Dipuo Peters has contradicted earlier evidence at the State Capture Commission in Johannesburg by then Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) board chair Popo Molefe that former president Jacob Zuma wanted to reinstate the entity’s former CEO Lucky Montana back to his position – after he had resigned. The commission continues its hearings on Monday afternoon.
