Two suspects have appeared at the KwaMsane Magistrate’s Court in Mtubatuba in northern KwaZulu-Natal for the murder of Joyce Gumede and her husband Mfanazi Gumede in November last year. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele said it is alleged that the couple was at home when two unknown suspects attacked them and opened fire. “Mfanazi attempted to flee the scene but was shot twice on the back and head and his wife was shot three times in the forehead. The couple was declared dead at the scene. Dedicated detectives from KwaMsane made a breakthrough when they arrested Mthethwa at his hide out in Tembisa, Gauteng. The second suspect Ndlela was traced and arrested in Mtubatuba.” #sapsKZN 2 Hitmen aged 22 and 23 arrested for alleged murder of a couple.
