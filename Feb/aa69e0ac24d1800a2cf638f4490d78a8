Paralympian and convicted murderer Oscar Pistorius is now eligible for parole in March 2023. The Supreme Court of Appeal has amended its decision to increase his sentence after it admitted to an error. It has emerged that the judgment failed to take into account the more than 500 days he had already served. Pistorius killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, on Valentineâ€™s Day in 2013. On that day, the world woke up to the shocking news that Pistorius had shot and killed Steenkamp at his house in Pretoria. Pistorius fired four times through the door of his bedroom toilet where Steenkamp was. He has maintained that he mistook her for a burglar. He was initially found guilty of culpable homicide, but when he appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal in 2015, that was changed to murder. In December 2017, Pistorius filed an application to the Constitutional Court seeking to overturn a higher prison sentence handed down by the Appeals Court in November of the same year. The Supreme Court had increased his sentence by 13 years and five months. The court more than doubled the charge from six years for shooting dead Steenkamp.
