Three people have been killed and two seriously injured in a head-on collision on the  R538 Road between White River and Hazyview in Mpumalanga. The deceased who are all men, aged between 25 and 35, died on the scene. The injured have been rushed to Themba Hospital. Road officials are still investigating the cause of the crash. Provincial MEC of Community Safety, Vusi Shongwe, has called on motorists to obey the rules of the road and also avoid driving when they are tired. In the North West, four vehicles were involved in a crash on the Ottoshoop bridge between Zeerust and Mahikeng. The crash happened after a driver swerved to avoid a man sprawled on the road. He lost control of his vehicle and veered into the oncoming lane, where he was bumped by another car. Two more vehicles driving towards Mahikeng collided with the first and second vehicles. “Swift response by law enforcement avoided further collisions as traffic was flowing on both sides of the road. There was a delay as motorists were redirected. The person who was found slumped on the road was taken to Mahikeng provincial hospital. Police are investigating a curious incident and thankfully no one was injured,” says a spokesperson for the department of safety, Alpheus Koonyaditse. In the Eastern Cape, six people were killed in a single-car crash in Mthatha.
