Govt to vaccinate 10 million Zimbabweans against Covid19 https://t.co/eYd4mmyEpM — Ministry of Information, Publicity & Broadcasting (@InfoMinZW) February 10, 2021  “The donation of 200 000 doses and an initial batch of 600000 doses which the Zimbabwe government has purchased are expected in the country by February 15, 2021 and the first week of March 2021 respectively,” she said. Only a handful of African nations have begun giving vaccinations as the continent scrambles to obtain supplies for its 1.3 billion people, even as many richer nations are racing ahead with mass immunisation campaigns. Zimbabwe has set aside $100 million for vaccine procurement and is looking to buy 20 million doses in a bid to immunize about 60% of its population and achieve herd immunity. The Sinopharm announcement comes as COVID-19 cases surge in the country of around 15 million people. It has so far reported 34 864 confirmed cases of the virus and 1 364 deaths, the majority of which have been recorded since the start of this year.
