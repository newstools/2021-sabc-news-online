Political analyst Lukhona Mnguni says the country needs to start talking about a future beyond the African National Congress (ANC) as the party has decided to sink the entire country into a discourse of division that goes against the common good. He was commenting on the looming meeting between the leadership of the party and former President Jacob Zuma to discuss his refusal to testify at the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture. Zuma is sought by the Commission to respond to almost 50 witnesses who have implicated him. Mnguni says what prompted the meeting is the enormous pressure the party has been dealing with in terms of court rulings and the ANC’s governance. He says the state should do scenario planning to make sure that no one gets hurt and there is no bloodshed should Zuma get arrested. He says no possibility should be dismissed. Mnguni elaborates on his views in the video below:  Zuma has vowed not to return to the Zondo Commission, citing elements of bias, among other concerns. Some members of the uMkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKVA) have been camping outside his Nkandla home in KwaZulu-Natal, vowing to defend the former president from arrest.
