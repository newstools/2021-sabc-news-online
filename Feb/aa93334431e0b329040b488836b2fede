The United Nations World Food Programme says it needs $107 million urgently for its emergency response in Ethiopia’s northern region of Tigray. The agency estimates that three million people will need emergency food assistance until late this year. The Tigray region has seen a military offensive by federal forces against regional troops since November last year. The government accused the political leadership in the region of being against the constitutional order. The UN food agency says the funds will buy and deliver food for one million people and it will provide nutritional support for 875 000 children and pregnant or nursing mothers. The Ethiopian government says so far 3.1 million people have received basic assistance. It has given over 29 international organisations access to offer humanitarian assistance. But, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs says the humanitarian response remains inadequate compared to the needs on the ground. The international community continues to voice concerns over the humanitarian situation in Tigray. According to a statement from the White House, US President Joe Biden emphasised the need to prevent further loss of life and ensure humanitarian access in his recent call with Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Prime Minister of Canada also raised the issue of the situation in Tigray in a conversation with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Meanwhile, Amnesty International has released a report suggesting Ethiopian and Eritrean troops committed action that may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity in Axum, a city in the Tigray region. The government’s human rights body says the findings by Amnesty International “should be taken very seriously.”
