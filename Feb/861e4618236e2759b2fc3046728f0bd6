Black Lives First (BLF) says although it has amended its constitution, white people are still not welcome in the party. The BLF collected its registration certificate as a political party at the IEC headquarters in Centurion on Friday. The BLF was deregistered in 2019, after the Electoral Court ruled in favour of an application to remove it from the IEC’s books. This came after the Freedom Front Plus took the party and the IEC to court arguing that its registration in 2016 was irregular as its constitution violated the Electoral Commission Act by limiting membership to black people. BLF leader Andile Mngxitama addressed the media outside the IEC offices. He says white people have their own parties in the FF+ and the DA. “The mandate this leadership was given by our members, was to meet the criteria to be able to represent our people in elections and we’ve met that criteria. That criteria does not say we should have white people amongst us. White people have their party the FF+, the DA, they even have funny things like Afriforum and Solidarity, all those things. What do they want in our movement?” Mngxithama urged President Cyril Ramaphosa to appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture.
