Former President Jacob Zuma has again hit back at the State Capture Commission saying he would rather go to jail than testify before it. He was supposed to appear before the Commission on Monday, but instead, he sent a letter to the Commission through his lawyers that he would not appear before the Commission. Zuma’s lawyers said he would not appear because the Constitutional Court was due to hear their client’s application for the Commission’s chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo’s recusal and that the summons issued for his appearance was illegal. In a 12 page scathing letter released on social media, he says there is nothing that will make him change his mind about the State Capture Commission. However, he states that he respects the rule of law in the country, but he will never appear before a process that he describes as impartial.
