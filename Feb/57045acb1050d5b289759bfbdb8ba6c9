Twelve people, including three South African Social Security Agency (Sassa), officials, have been arrested for the alleged fraud and corruption involving disability grants in and around Tzaneen in Limpopo. Limpopo Hawks spokesperson, Captain Matimba Maluleke, says the Sassa officials allegedly recruited an intermediary and registered non-qualifying people for disability grants. Maluleke says they are expecting to make more arrests. “Our investigations have revealed that over 21 people were recruited and paid R3 500 gratification each resulting in a loss of over R300 000 by the department. The suspects include three Nkowankowa Sassa officials, one intermediary and eight non qualifying Sassa beneficiaries. They are expected to appear in the Tzaneen Magistrate’s Court soon to face charges relating to fraud and  corruption,” explains Maluleke. Discussion on SASSA’s fight against fraud and corruption:
