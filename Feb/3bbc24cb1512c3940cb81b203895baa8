African National Congress (ANC) Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte has described the late anti-apartheid activist and freedom fighter Mama Rebecca Kotane as an embodiment of both the history of ANC and South Africa. She passed away on 31 January, a few days before her 109th birthday, and was laid to rest on 6 February at Phela village, near Zeerust, in the North West.  Duarte has been speaking at a joint virtual memorial service held by the ANC and the South African Communist Party (SACP) in Kotane’s honour. “Indeed a woman of foresight, a woman of great strength and she has seen many things that makes her an embodiment actually of not just the ANC history but the history of South Africa. She spent a large part of her time in Gauteng, in Alex. But during the last few decades, she was a resident of Soweto. She brought up a family in difficult times but always positive and lively.” ANC & SACP  joint virtual memorial service for Mama Rebecca Kotane https://t.co/DHig9IzRy7 — African National Congress (@MYANC) February 9, 2021  Kotane has been remembered for her participation in the 1956 Women’s March to the Union Buildings.

The President of the African National Congress Women’s League Bathabile Dlamini has thanked those who have been taking care of Kotane. “The Kotane family has been part of the struggle until the end. We want to thank the family for looking after her, taking care of her, and allowing everyone to visit Mma Kotane, we always found her in good shape. We would also like to thank the movement, the alliance for looking after the Kotane family during difficult times. “
