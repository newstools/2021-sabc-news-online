The Hawks have arrested 11 people as part of ongoing investigations into the abuse of Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme (TERS) claims, valued at more than R41 million. Officials from the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) revealed this when briefing Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Employment and Labour on their investigations into the management of the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF). The arrests relate to companies that defrauded the UIF. SIU chief investigator Johnny le Roux says, “The SIU was alerted on 20 October 2020 that 11 [suspects have] been arrested. The Hawks will ensure [that] Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) is brought on board to assist in recoveries of ill gotten gains.” In the video below from December 2020, acting UIF Commissioner Marsha Bronkhors discusses UIF outstanding payments:  In August 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed confidence that there will be successful conviction of those found guilty of COVID-19 related corruption.
