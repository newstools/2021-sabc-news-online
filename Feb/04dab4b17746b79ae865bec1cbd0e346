A 32-year-old man whose been arrested as an accomplice to the murder of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule is expected to appear in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court on Monday. He was taken into custody last Thursday when police swooped on his home in Florida, west of Johannesburg. Man suspected of masterminding Tshegofatso Pule’s murder in court:  The man is believed to have been the boyfriend of Tshegofatso Pule. Last week, the High Court in Johannesburg heard that the man, known only as Shoba, had conspired with Muzikayise Malephane to kill Pule so that his wife wouldn’t find out that she was pregnant. Malephane told the court that Shoba had agreed to pay him R70 000 to make it look like a suicide. On Friday, Muzikayise Malephane pleaded guilty to killing Pule and received a 20-year jail term from the High Court in Johannesburg after entering into a plea agreement with the state.  In June last year, an eight months pregnant Pule’s body was found in an open veld in Roodepoort. Her body was hanging from a tree and had stab wounds to the chest. Family Pule’s uncle, Tumisang Katate said the family finds this too much to bear. “Our hearts are still heavy, we are still emotional. The planning and the execution of it, for what? How the prices went up; it’s like they were at an auction for the killing of a person. It’s like the life of a person was being auctioned simply because you did not want your wife to find out that you have impregnated another woman outside. And this thing was simple; he was supposed to say he does not want anything to do with the baby. The baby could have been raised and there’s a lot of babies that were raised without fathers and they turned out okay.” Shock and disappointment on latest revelations:
