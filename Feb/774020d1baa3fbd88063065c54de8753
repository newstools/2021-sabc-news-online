Tshivhengwa says he hopes that government’s vaccination rollout programme is a step in the right direction. “The damage is going to be felt over the next few years to come. The world would bounce back. We will be able to rebuild, we will be able to go back to where we are, if not do better than where we were.

Many people would lose their jobs, but nonetheless, we have to move on, we have to have hope and move back to some level of trade,” explains Tshivhengwa.
