This included the establishment of AU COVID-19 response fund, the establishment of the Africa task force for coronavirus, the partnership to accelerate COVID-19 testing in Africa, the consortium for COVID-19 clinical vaccine trials and the appointment of special envoys to mobilise international support for the continent’s fight against the pandemic.” The South African delegation to the AU Summit is led by President Ramaphosa who will be joined by Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Naledi Pandor, Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize, Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Ebrahim Patel, Minister of State Security Ayanda Dlodlo, Minister of Defence and Military Veterans Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture Nkosinathi Mthethwa.
