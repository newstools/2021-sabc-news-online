Member of Parliament’s Justice and Correctional Services Committee James Selfe is scheduled to testify again at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg on Friday morning. OUTA’s Parliamentary Engagement Manager Matt Johnston, National Assembly Committees Chairperson Cedric Frolic, former Transport Committee chairperson Dikeledi Magadzi and former Correctional Services Committee chairperson Vincent Smith could also give evidence. On Thursday, former chairperson of Parliament’s Portfolio Committee for Public Service Makhosi Khoza told the Commission that she experienced backlash from both the African National Congress’s national leadership and her home province of KwaZulu-Natal, after voting with the opposition in August 2017 in a vote of no confidence in former President Jacob Zuma. “For me, it was clear that the ANC had adopted corruption as its new policy. It was an official policy because the only thing I was guilty of was to stand for what was right I did not do anything wrong in terms of my role as a member of parliament I don’t believe that I brought the name of the ANC into disrepute but it appeared as though I was the one who was guilty of having done something wrong, not those who had done something wrong so I resigned” Commission hears Parliamentary Oversight related evidence: Makhosi Khoza
