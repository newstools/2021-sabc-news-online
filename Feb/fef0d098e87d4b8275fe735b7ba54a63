Mayor of the Lekwa-Teemane Local Municipality in Christiana in the North West, Mpho Pilane has resigned. His resignation comes ahead of a special council sitting to debate a motion of no confidence in him. The Forum 4 Service Delivery brought the motion. This after Pilane was charged with two counts of sexual assault, rape and abduction. He allegedly sexually assaulted and raped two girls aged 15 and 16. Pilane says his resignation is not an admission of guilt. “I have taken a decision to tender my resignation. I have already submitted my letter of resignation to the interim provincial committee (IPC) coordinator.” “I must also indicate that that is prompted by the fact that the National Executive Committee (NEC) took a decision to adopt the guidelines which are going to guide the process on all the members who are faced with different cases or who are appearing before the court of law. I serve at the behest of the ANC that deployed me,” says Pilane.
