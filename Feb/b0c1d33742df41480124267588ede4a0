The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has briefed Parliament on its investigations into the management of the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF). One of the SIU investigators, Johnny Le Roux, says their investigations into the Temporary Employer-Employee Relief Scheme (TERS) found irregularities of just over R6 million. In the video below from December last year, acting UIF Commissioner Marsha Bronkhors discusses UIF outstanding payments:  This involves awareness campaigns for TERS by means of advertising on radio. Le Roux says they found that proper supply chain management procedures were not followed. “No proper supply chain management (SCM) followed to appoint five companies for awareness campaign relating to TERS and that these payments made on the motivation of sole service provider. SIU started an investigation into the matter in August 2020, value amounting to R6.1 million,” explains Le Roux. Meanwhile, in August 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa said he was confident that there will be successful conviction of those found guilty of COVID-19 related corruption. Graft allegations, implicating government officials and those close to them, have been rife amid the pandemic. Editorial Note: Our earlier version had the SIU investigator as Johnny De Lange, which has been corrected to Johnny Le Roux.
