Liquor industry welcomes partial lifting of alcohol ban:  The municipality’s Samkelo Ngwenya says, “The command council is going to meet tomorrow to evaluate some of these disturbing emergences, the regulations are very clear about on-site consumption of alcohol, the times that are permitted as well as issues that talk to protocol about venue capacity as well as practicing of protocols that are related to this. We are very encouraged by businesses and churches that are responsible but we are also very much concerned about the ones that we have picked up reports that they are transgressing the law.” More than 40 drunk drivers arrested in Johannesburg Meanwhile, Law Enforcement Agencies in Johannesburg have arrested more than 40 drunken drivers since the latest ban on the sale of alcohol was lifted last week.
