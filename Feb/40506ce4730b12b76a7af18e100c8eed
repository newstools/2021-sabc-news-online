Health Minister Zweli Mkhize and President Cyril Ramaphosa have both been vaccinated at the Khayelitsha District Hospital in the Western Cape. Taking the vaccine was quick, easy and not so painful. I urge all our healthcare workers to register to receive their vaccinations as they are our first line of defence against the coronavirus pandemic. #WeChooseVacciNation #VaccineforSouthAfrica  pic.twitter.com/11tyl1f9Xs — Cyril Ramaphosa  #StaySafe (@CyrilRamaphosa) February 17, 2021  Mkhize says talks with vaccine manufacturers are progressing well and the government is confident it will manage to secure the required number of vaccine doses to reach its goal of vaccinating 40 million people by the end of the year. “We are expecting between now and the end of four weeks we should at least be able to reach about 500 000 doses that we should be able to receive. They will be coming in waves week by week. We will actually be vaccinating at the same time running an implementation study.  We are going to continue the observations of all of those who will be vaccinated. We are anticipating also that there will be additional doses that will come from Pfizer within the next months. We are expecting about half a million of those doses by June.  We have a commitment by Pfizer of about seven million doses.”
