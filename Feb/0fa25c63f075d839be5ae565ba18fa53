Biopharmaceutical company Biovac says security has been stepped up at its facility where COVID-19 vaccines are stored before distribution. The company which is a public-private partnership between government and the Biovac Consortium has been appointed to provide storage and distribution services for the vaccines for three months. South Africa’s first consignment of vaccines arrived at OR Tambo International Airport on Monday. President Ramaphosa receives COVID-19 vaccines from India:  Biovac CEO Dr Morena Makhoana says it’s necessary to enhance security. “Security is clearly uppermost in the minds of many South Africans and it’s something that we have also heightened. So under normal circumstances, our cold rooms are under security watch, we have cameras and security in our premises – but this [time] security has been enhanced.” “So, we have lifted it up ourselves through private security companies. Government has also stepped up and provided through the security cluster – additional security at our premises,” adds Makhoana.
