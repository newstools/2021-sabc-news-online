Political differences between Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta and his Deputy William Ruto came to the fore again on Friday, when at a political rally Kenyatta dared Ruto and his allies to resign if they are not satisfied with the current administration. Without mentioning names, Kenyatta told a crowd of supporters that one cannot continue to insult people while also taking credit for the government’s success. Kenyatta and Ruto fell out following the decision by the Kenyan head of state to mend fences with opposition leader Raila Odinga. Media reports on Friday indicated that Ruto’s allies were planning a mass walkout from the ruling Jubilee Party. It’s over a year to the next General elections in Kenya, but with President Kenyatta not vying for the presidency, the race to succeed him is on. On the one hand, his deputy William Ruto is angling to succeed him. On the other hand, is former Prime Minister and opposition leader Raila Odinga who has crossed ranks with Kenyatta in March 2018 and is working with Kenyatta to push for constitutional reforms ahead of the elections. This has angered Ruto. Kenyatta however says Ruto and his allies should resign if they are not satisfied with his leadership. While Odinga remains Kenyatta’s topmost defender, Ruto now seems to lead the opposition against his boss but still within the ruling Jubilee party.
