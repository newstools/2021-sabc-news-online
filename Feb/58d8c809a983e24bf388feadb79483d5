“Military veterans should never find themselves in situations where they are used to sow divisions or counter-revolution in a country. Military veterans are an investment in a country. They should strive all the time to ensure that there’s peace and stability in a country alongside members of the Defence Force.” Ex-combatants of the ANC’s former military wing are camping outside Zuma’s home at Nkandla for the fourth day. This as the Umkhonto weSizwe National Council has called on the ANC leadership to discipline Zuma for not appearing before the State Capture Inquiry on Monday. The Council has also called on the ANC to take steps against MKMVA President, Kebby Maphatsoe, for his support of Zuma’s stance and the alleged defiance of the Constitutional Court order. Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has indicated that the commission will ask the Constitutional Court to find Zuma guilty of contempt of court and hand down a prison sentence. MKMVA members outside the Zuma home say they are there to prevent any attempt to arrest Zuma. More supporters join MKMVA outside Zuma’s homestead in Nkandla:  The family of the former president says there is no amount of persuasion that will change his view of State Capture Commission Chair Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. They say the ANC national leadership is welcome to meet with Zuma, but that he won’t testify before the commission if Zondo does not recuse himself. The ANC leadership in KwaZulu-Natal indicated last week that they will ask the party’s top national leadership to meet with Zuma.
