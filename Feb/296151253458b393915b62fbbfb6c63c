The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the North West says they intend to ask for a postponement in order to give new prosecutors an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the content of the case docket. Nelson allegedly irregularly appointed the former HoD of the provincial department of Health, Dr. Thabo Lekalakala, to the position in 2014.

Lekalakala was later fired by Premier Job Mokgoro following a disciplinary hearing.
