KwaZulu-Natal police are continuing their search for a learner who was kidnapped from a school in Newlands West in Durban. Police spokesperson Thembeka Mbele says 17-year-old Mmeli Ngcobo was allegedly taken on Monday after he was accused of stealing a classmate’s cellphone. Mbele says it’s alleged the parents arrived at the school and confronted Ngcobo. The boy was given until Monday to return the phone. She says it’s believed that the classmate and two other males in gold or silver Mercedes-Benz approached Ngcobo later and forced him into a vehicle. Mbele says police arrested two suspects. “There was a suspect who was arrested. In fact, there were two and one was released because there was no evidence initially. Then the one that was arrested, the owner of the cellphone, but then when his case was taken to court. It was not enrolled because of insufficient evidence. For now, there is still an investigation that should be done. So, once it’s done the case is going to be taken back for decision.”
