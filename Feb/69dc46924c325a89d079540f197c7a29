Four people including three toddlers have been killed in a crash on the N1 near Touwsriver in the Karoo. The crash happened when the car they were travelling in hit the back of a stationary truck on Thursday morning. Traffic spokesperson Jandre Bakker says the fourth person is the driver of the car. He says the crash has caused traffic congestion. “Preliminary reports suggest that a light motor vehicle drove into the back of the stationary heavy motor vehicle which had broken down. Currently, four fatalities have been reported, three of which are children under the age of five. The N1 has been closed in order for the recovery to be completed,” explains Bakker.
