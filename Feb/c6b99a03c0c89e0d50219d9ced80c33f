The World Health Organisation (WHO) says COVAX is expected to start sending millions of COVID-19 vaccines to Africa this month. The Statement by the WHO says COVAX has notified countries in Africa of the estimated dose allocation for the first phase of COVID-19 vaccine delivery. The global initiative led by the WHO, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) aims to start shipping nearly 90 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to the continent in February, in what will be Africa’s largest-ever mass vaccination campaign. The rollout of the AstraZeneca/Oxford AZD1222 vaccine is subject to the vaccine being listed for emergency use by WHO. The organisation is currently reviewing the vaccine and the outcome of the review is expected soon. Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti says, “Africa has watched other regions start COVID-19 vaccination campaigns from the side-lines for too long. This planned rollout is a critical first step to ensuring the continent gets equitable access to vaccines. We know no one will be safe until everyone is safe.” Below is the full statement by the WHO: Below is the full interview with Dr. Atuhebwe:
