Unions at bus company Greyhound have met with management in the first Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) facilitated section 189 consultations. The discussion took place amid the suspension of the company’s operations with effect from February 14, 2021. Labour union the Democratised Transport Logistics and Allied Workers Union (Detawu) says the CCMA process will afford unions a chance to speak to management and propose other ways of saving 700 jobs in the company. Detawu General-Secretary Nontobeko Luzipo says, “Detawu raised pertinent questions why the employer decided to issue one notice instead of three, these three being Greyhound, Magic Transfer and MagaBus. The commissioner agreed that it was irregular, the employer also could not explain why they had not opted for business rescue…” “The employer is expected to respond by this Wednesday. We will have a chance to look into the company’s finances by February 23, 2021. A second consultation will take place on February 24, 2021,” added Luzipo. Shock as Greyhound bus service collapses:  Greyhound and its subdivision, Citiliner closed operations on Sunday leaving at least 700 people without jobs. The company had been operating for more than 35 years and was one of the first coach operators to begin services in South Africa, with an extensive route network covering all the major cities in the country, including Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, East London and Pretoria. Greyhound also operated services to Harare and Bulawayo in Zimbabwe and Maputo in Mozambique. The company announced its decision to close down at the beginning of February saying the COVID-19 outbreak had a negative impact on its coffers.
