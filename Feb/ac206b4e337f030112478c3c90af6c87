The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture says former President Jacob Zuma’s decision to defy the order of the Constitutional Court displays a complete disregard for the rights and interests that South Africans have, to obtain comprehensive responses from him to evidence regarding allegations of State capture, corruption and fraud. On Monday, Zuma told the Commission in a statement, that he would not appear before the Commission. The former President’s decision goes against the Constitutional Court’s order last week that he must appear before the Commission, give evidence and obey all the directives given by the inquiry. The court ruled that he is compelled to appear before the Commission and will not be allowed to exercise his right to keep silent. Justice Christopher Jafta delivers the judgment against Zuma:  The Commission says should the former President go ahead with his decision not to appear before it on February 15, he will be in breach of the summons and in contempt of the order of the Constitutional Court. The Commission says it will announce on that day what further action it will take regarding such conduct. The Commission also describes as unacceptable, Zuma’s decision that he will defy the order of the country’s highest court and the summons of the Commission – particularly so, when the person making such a decision is a former President of the country who should be exemplary in upholding the rule of law and the Constitution.
