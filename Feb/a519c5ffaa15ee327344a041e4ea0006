The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine trials are continuing at 36 sites in the country. In Limpopo, the study into the efficacy and safety of the vaccine is being conducted at the Ndlovu Research Facility in Moutse. 602 participants from Limpopo and Mpumalanga have enrolled for the trial at the centre that started in November last year. Principal investigator, Dr Rebone Maboa says the participants are closely monitored for symptoms in a series of follow up appointments. “We encourage them to also report the symptoms and the signs in their e-diary,  these are some of the things we expect from our participants. We are excited to be participating in this trial, and study,  Ndlovu Centre in Limpopo is the only centre in Limpopo that is participating with the national Department of Health in this regard.” Dr Maboa says some participants were initially sceptical. “From the participants’ side, initially they were sceptics but because of the education they are very happy with the vaccine and I think they are also excited about the fact that they became a part of a study that became a success. The Johnson & Johnson study will carry over in the next two years. This is where the follow up will be done for our participants and the health care workers as well and these are two separate studies, it is a vaccine trial and the vaccine rollout.” 9.9 million doses of the vaccine have been secured :
