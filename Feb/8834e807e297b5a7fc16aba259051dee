The trial of Nigerian pastor, Timothy Omotoso, resumes in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Monday after a halt in proceedings the whole of last week. Omotoso and his two co-accused are facing more than 90 sex and human trafficking-related charges. The state alleges that the two co-accused lured young women from the Jesus Dominion International Church to a mission house near Durban where they were expected to undergo spiritual training. The fifth witness in the case is expected to be cross-examined by Omotoso’s defence attorney, Peter Daubermann when the trial resumes. Up to now, the testimony of all the witnesses painted the same picture, the promise of a better life, money, a career in music, or spiritual training. But the promises ended up in sexual abuse with the witnesses testifying they were all influenced by the pastor’s so-called power over them. They all saw him as a man of God. Omotoso was arrested more than four years ago and remains in custody. The case is on the court roll for another month with more than 20 witnesses to be called.
