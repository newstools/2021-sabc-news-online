The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) says it is about time South Africa introduced substantive and meaningful change in its fight against corruption. The organisation was reacting to a Transparency International 2020 “Corruption Perceptions Index”, showing the extent to which corruption has impacted the world. South Africa barely shifted its position, coming in again with a score of 44 out of 100 and ranked 69, alongside Bulgaria, Hungary, Jamaica, Romania and Tunisia. Outa CEO Wayne Duvenage says, “The extent of corruption is serious and becoming endemic in South Africa. Does corruption add to the cost of business? Does corruption reduce our competitiveness as a country. Are we paying more for services in this country than we should be? Just one thing, electricity, we are paying much more than we should because of corruption, gross maladministration and lack of leadership.” On Monday, a Corruption Watch also released a report, highlighting failures in the administration of the Temporary Employment Relief Scheme (TERS). They include alleged corruption by some employers, who received the government’s relief funds but did not pay the workers.
