The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) spent at least R70 million on investigating widespread corruption in the
procurement of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) by the end of December 2020. The SIU’s chief financial officer (CFO) Andre Gernandt was briefing Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) on the report it released last week on investigations it had done during the National State of Disaster. Contracts of more than R13 billion for COVID-19 related equipment are under investigation. In the video below, SIU briefed the media on investigations into alleged COVID-19 PPEs procurement corruption:  Gernandt says the money the unit spent on its investigations excludes litigation costs. “The cost incurred up until the end of December runs at R70 million. This is now made up of the different resources in the SIU working on,” explains Gernandt.
