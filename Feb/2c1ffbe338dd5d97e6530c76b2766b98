The Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court in Limpopo has postponed the bail application of a 34-year-old woman who is the alleged mastermind of her husband’s murder to next week. She appeared in court with three co-accused. Ntanganedzeni Nemaranzhe and her co-accused Tshivhangwaho Mudau, Tshililo Madega and Takalani Nemutandani started their bail application on Tuesday. They allegedly murdered businessman Azwifaneli Mudau on Valentine’s Day in 2019. Mudau was shot dead in front of his gate in Thohoyandou. When the case started, two of the four accused – Takalani Nemutandani and Tshivhangwaho Mudau – abandoned their bail application. The other two co-accused – Ntanganedzeni Nemaranzhe and Tshililo Madega – opted to continue with their application. Madega has concluded his testimony. Nemaranzhe will start with her application for bail when the matter continues on Tuesday next week. The matter has been set for Tuesday and Wednesday. Nemaranzhe’s legal representative Advocate Anneline van den Heever told the court that she will submit an affidavit to the court for her client’s bail application. The prosecution made an application last week for the bail application to be postponed to enable them to centralise all pending cases against three of the four accused, Madega, Nemutandani and Mudau. They are facing charges of armed robbery and murder in Thohoyandou and Vuwani respectively. The prosecution has, however, not centralised the cases as it did not get centralisation certificate from the Thohoyandou High Court. This was due to a power outage in the Thohoyandou High Court. The four accused have been remanded in custody.
