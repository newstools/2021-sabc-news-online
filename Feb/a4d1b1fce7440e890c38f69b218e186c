Western Cape Judge President John Hlophe has lashed out at the state for failure to make witnesses available in the corruption case involving former State Security Minister Bongani Bongo. Hlophe was angry that the Secretary to the National Council of Provinces Modibedi Phindela was not available this afternoon.  The court had to adjourn earlier for lunch because Secretary to the National Assembly Masibulele Xaso was also not available and only gave evidence after two in the afternoon. Hlophe described the failure by Phindela to appear in court as bordering on contempt. He said he was very angry about that. Bongo is accused of attempting to bribe then evidence leader in the Parliamentary inquiry into Eskom Advocate Ntuthuzelo Vanara. Bongo has said previously that he has ever been involved in corruption:  In his testimony, Xaso told the court that he was invited by Phindela to a meeting with Vanara. He says Vanara informed them of being approached by Bongo with the proposal to collapse the inquiry. When pressed by Bongo’s legal counsel Mike Hellens on why he had not reported the matter to the police, he said he had reported it to a higher authority who was the acting secretary to Parliament Baby Tyawa. Hlophe adjourned the hearing to Friday and warned the state to make sure their witnesses are available.
