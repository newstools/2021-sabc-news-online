ANC activist Mzomuhle Dube who was also the spokesperson for the supporters of former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede has died in a Durban hospital after a short illness. Ethekwini councillor Ntando Khuzwayo says Dube was rushed to King Edward VIII hospital on Thursday. “It is with great sorrow that we confirm the untimely passing of Comrade Mzomuhle Dube after a very short illness. He was rushed to King Edward hospital on Thursday morning, after complaining about fatigue and unfortunately in the evening he was admitted to the ICU ward and he passed on.” Khuzwayo has described Dube as an activist who fought for the liberation of the country. “He is a person who survived a number of attempts that were apartheid sponsored against his life. They have shot him several times but he survived and just when we have gotten our freedom. And we think 0ur country is moving forward. He passes on. And he came to eThekwini region and he served the ANC very well. We really dip our revolutionary banner in honour of this very dedicated, very fearless, very robust Comrade who was very kind.”
