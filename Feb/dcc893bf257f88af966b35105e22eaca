One the VIN numbers and the engine are tampered with. The second one it’s a foreign registered vehicle. It’s driving on our roads without the temporary import permit and is also driven by the South African. So it is not allowed.” “We have two people we have arrested for dagga. There is also dagga which we found abandoned in a taxi. So these people when they realise that there’s a roadblock, the owner of the dagga decided to jump out of the taxi and leave the dagga. The individual is arrested,” explains Mawela.  Community engagement in Mamelodi West is currently underway. #GrowingGautengTogether pic.twitter.com/Og52yWsU5G — GP Community Safety (@GP_CommSafety) February 25, 2021
