The government will roll out a free mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign for which money has been allocated in the medium term. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, tabling the 2021-2022 budget revenue projected to be R1.35 trillion, says “a successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is critical for saving lives and bring economic activities to normality and improve growth.” He allocates more than R10 billion to the COVID-19 vaccination programme and enlarged the contingency plan to accommodate the nation’s fight against COVID-19. “With this framework, we provide the budget for South Africa’s vaccination campaign. This campaign allows us to emerge from the restrictions to economic activity.  We are allocating more than R10 billion  for the purchase and delivery of vaccines over the next two years.” He allocated R3.5 billion to assist in early childhood development services and basic education.  “Provinces will receive R3.5 billion to the Department of Social Development to improve access to early childhood development services, R 6.3 billion is allocated to extend the special COVID-19 social relief of distress grant until the end of April 2021, in addition, R678 million earmarked for provincial Departments of Social Development and basic education to continue rolling out free sanitary products for learners from low-income households.”  Mboweni says he was enthusiastic about the budget as it extends support to the economy and public health services.
