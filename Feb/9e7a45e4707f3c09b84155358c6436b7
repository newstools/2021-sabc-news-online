The United States government has called on Somali leaders to work fast to resolve the electoral impasse that threatens Somalia’s future. It also warns that the political gridlock of the past year has resulted in a disappointing lack of progress in fighting al-Shabaab and improving security, as well as advancing economic development. Somalia was due to hold Presidential elections on Monday (February 8) but emergency talks between Somalia’s divided political leaders over the weekend ended without agreement on how to proceed with elections. On Monday, Somalia’s opposition leaders announced that they no longer recognise President Mohamed “Farmajo” Abdullahi Mohamed, after his term expired without a political agreement on a path toward elections to replace him. Monday’s deadline to hold indirect parliamentary and presidential was missed as Farmajo and the regional leaders disagreed over how to conduct the vote. The US government warned that the ongoing Somali crisis has hindered the country’s progress in fighting violent militant insurgency, hunger and an ongoing locust invasion, outing many lives at risk. Now a coalition of opposition leaders want Farmajo to put together a transitional council to lead the country until elections are held.
