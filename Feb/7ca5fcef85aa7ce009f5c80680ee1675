He was also declared unfit to possess a firearm and his name will appear in the National Register of Sexual offenders. Police spokesperson, Motlafela Mojapelo, says the case is closed. “We didn’t have any evidence that pointed that the children were raped. There was no evidence that linked the neighbour to this crime. That is why then we also decide to take some DNA samples, but they also came back negative. Then the statement from the neighbour and one of the children, you know, they were so young. They could(not) even explain exactly what happened. We then took the docket for decision and the prosecutor decided not to prosecute,” Mojapelo explains.
