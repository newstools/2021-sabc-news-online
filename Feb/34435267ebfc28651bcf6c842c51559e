Lawyers for Human Rights say it would be unconstitutional for the government to only administer the COVID-19 vaccine to residents and leave out undocumented migrants.

I think that it’s in the context of a crisis of the asylum system in our country that many people are waiting, there are over 200 000 people who don’t have their papers to confirm their status as refugees in our country. That alone is reason enough to challenge this,” says Ekambarami. COVID-19 Vaccine | Discussion on the complexities of the vaccine roll-out strategy
