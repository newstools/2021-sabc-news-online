The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein, in the Free State, has dismissed Nigerian rape-accused Pastor Timothy Omotoso’s application for leave to appeal a High Court order which denied him bail. The SCA ruled that there were no reasonable prospects of success and no compelling reasons as to why an appeal should be heard. Omotoso is on trial in the High Court in the Eastern Cape together with co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho. Below is a report on Omotoso’s previous bail application at a PE court:  They face several charges, including rape, human trafficking and racketeering, for allegedly targeting and recruiting young girls for sexual exploitation.
