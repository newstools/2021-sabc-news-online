The High Court in the Western Cape has dismissed with costs, an application by a faction of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) for leave to appeal a December interim ruling that reinstated Mzwanele Nyhontso as the party’s representative in Parliament. Last year, National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise revoked Nyhontso’s membership of the Assembly after she received a letter from a faction, led by Narius Moloto, that he was to be replaced. Nyhontso successfully challenged his removal. The interim order was granted pending the decision of the High Court in Pretoria on the PAC’s leadership dispute. The parties are scheduled to return to court on the 15th of this month for a final ruling on whether Nyhotso should be removed as an MP. IEC recognises Mzwanele Nyhontso as PAC leader:
