President Cyril Ramaphosa and Parliament’s Presiding Officers lit three candles in memory of those who have lost their lives to the COVID-19 virus. This took place before his State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Thursday. The President and the Presiding Officers honoured and remembered South Africans who lost their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic during a candle lighting ceremony. This year’s SONA is a very subdued affair because of the pandemic with only 50 people allowed into the National Assembly chamber. At an earlier briefing, National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise, said it would be untoward to conduct the ceremony in the usual way. “We want to express our loss in the simplest way as parliament on the serious loss suffered as a country due to COVID-19.”  “There is no family, no community, that has not lost someone that they knew or someone that they loved.” #SONA2021 #MySONA — Presidency | South Africa  (@PresidencyZA) February 11, 2021   Link to the stream:
