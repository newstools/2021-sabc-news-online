The Nkomazi Local Municipality in Malalane, Mpumalanga says it is working hard to restore services such as water, electricity and fixing roads that were washed away by heavy rains. In some villages like Buffelspruit, residents have been left stranded as  bridges were washed away. The spokesperson for the Nkomazi Local Municipality, Cyril Repinga, says technical teams have been on the ground trying to restore services. “People do not get water as they are supposed to. All water infrastructure has been washed away, pumps have been submerged and this is giving us a serious problem. The road infrastructure is also affected, bridges are underwater.” Meanwhile, Mpumalanga Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC, Mandla Msibi, said on Saturday the cost of the damage caused by rains in the province has escalated to over a billion rand. Bridges, roads, and water infrastructure are among the valuable properties damaged by persistent rains. Msibi said water tankers have been dispatched to affected communities.
