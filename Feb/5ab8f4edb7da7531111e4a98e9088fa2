Parliament’s Home Affairs Committee says it welcomes the process initiated by Home Affairs to implement the findings of the Public Protector’s report on the Gupta family naturalisation matter. The committee says it has instructed the department to furnish it with a progress report at the end of next month. Acting committee chairperson, Mosa Chabane, says some of the remedial actions that Home Affairs will implement include disciplinary action against departmental officials who were involved in the naturalisation of Ajay Gupta and his family. The Public Protector has found that the officials failed to exercise due diligence in verifying the accuracy of the information contained in the motivation for the family’s early naturalisation. Earlier this month, advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane called on the Home Affairs Director-General to take action against the implicated officials. More on the story in the audio clip below:
