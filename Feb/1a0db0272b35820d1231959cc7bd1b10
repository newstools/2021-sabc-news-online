The State Capture Commission of Inquiry continues hearing testimony related to Parliamentary Oversight on Thursday afternoon. Earlier in the day, former ANC MP Dr Makhosi Khoza testified how party MPs were told that they would be betraying the ANC should they support the opposition in a vote of no confidence in former President Jacob Zuma in April 2017.
