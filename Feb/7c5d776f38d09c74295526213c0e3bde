Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says South Africa needs to rethink the current delivery of the curriculum. She was giving her closing remarks at the 2021 Virtual Basic Education Lekgotla, adding that it was both an honour and a privilege to host it. “Clearly, among the critical tasks we must perform with zeal, is the rethinking, repositioning, reimagining of our curriculum delivery; the theory, practice and instruments of teaching and learning; learning spaces; teacher development; as well as learning and assessments” said Motsheka. The lekgotla was hosted under the theme, “Equipping learners with knowledge and skills for a changing world” and featured various speakers from the continent and abroad. Provincial education departments, teacher unions, school governing bodies, learner organisations and NGOs were among the academics and international guest speakers, sharing their insights and expertise. The Minister thanked the delegates and praised them for their contribution to the virtual gathering.

Last year, Minister Motshekga hinted the curriculum was in its final stages and developed for grades R to 9. Its rollout is aimed at developing learner’s ability to solve problems, enhance critical thinking, and apply digital and ICT skills, among others. The President has also reiterated the need to continue to invest in early childhood development as the foundation for development, and create policy certainty where it is lacking.
