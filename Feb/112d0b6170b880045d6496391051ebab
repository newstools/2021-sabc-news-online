The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture will on Wednesday morning continue to hear evidence related to Eskom when the power utility’s former Board member Venete Klein testifies. In September last year, Klein explained to the Commission why the Board decided to pay out millions of rands to part ways with Eskom executives who were suspended in 2015. She admitted that they could have handled some of the decisions they took as Board members better. Klein was vocal in their dismissal and believed their exits were justified because they had not performed their jobs as intended. She also expressed discomfort that her name was one of those recommended by the Gupta brothers to serve in the 2014 Eskom Board. It is alleged the Guptas had an influence on who they wanted to serve in that Board and drafted a list of names. The newly elected 2014 Eskom Board became known as the Gupta Board.
