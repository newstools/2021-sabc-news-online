Members of the South African Local Government Association (Salga) are stepping up to donate Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) to benefit municipal workers across the country. The donations will target municipal waste collectors, health workers, water and sanitation officials and those working in cemeteries. The Oudtshoorn Municipality in the Little Karoo is the latest to benefit from the initiative. After the national state of disaster declaration last year Salga staff, councillors and municipal officials responded to the President’s call to contribute financially towards fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Salga Western Cape’s Khalil Mullajie says: “The PPE is mainly protective clothing, both latex as well as high duty gloves. That’s mainly for your frontline workers, where the risks are high and they’re vulnerable and exposed to the virus.” The municipality says essential workers at local government level provide an important service in their communities. In the video below, Salga condemns flouting of COVID-19 lockdown regulations by councillors:  The nature of their work, places them at risk of contracting the coronavirus. Oudtshoorn Mayor Chris Macpherson says: “This is going to help us tremendously, especially with our essential workers we have in the municipality, and to assist them to ensure they are protected adequately.  The type of equipment we received will definitely be beneficial to them all and will definitely utilise it in ensuring that our staff stay 100% safe.” Tablets were also donated, as part of an initiative with the European Union to enhance the capacity of municipalities to deliver services. They will be used to connect virtually with community members during ward committee meetings. The Theewaterskloof Municipality in the Overberg district also received the PPE from SALGA.
