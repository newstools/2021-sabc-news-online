Former Chairperson of the Correctional Services Portfolio Committee Vincent Smith has told the State Capture Commission that the committee was unable to stop the Department of Correctional Services’ recurring extension of contracts to Bosasa. A probe by the Special Investigating Unit in 2008 found that there was evidence that department officials were involved in bribery and corruption in the awarding of catering contracts to Bosasa and its affiliated companies Sondolo and Phezulu. Yet the contracts continued to be extended up until 2019. Smith was chairperson of the portfolio committee between 2009 and 2014. The Commission hears Parliamentary Oversight-related evidence:  Smith is facing corruption charges after former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi alleged Smith had received gifts and money for co-operating with Bosasa. “When it comes to the work that is done by the executive, government and departments who they offer what services they provide and so on ours as parliament as I understand it is the power to persuade we didn’t have the power to micro-manage or the powers to dictate and I want to say I am not offering that as an excuse but that was the power relationship and I believe it is still the relationship.”
