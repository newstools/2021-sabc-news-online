Economic Freedom Fighters leader, Julius Malema, is seeking a tough sanction from the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein against former party MP, Thembinkosi Rawula. Malema contends that the High Court should have interdicted Rawula from making false and defamatory statements against him. He says the High Court should have also ordered Rawula to pay damages. In April 2019, Rawula claimed on Facebook that Malema abused party funds for his lavish lifestyle. Malema demands 1-million rand damages from Rawula, saying the now-deleted Facebook post was designed to portray him as a corrupt leader who stole from party members. Counsel for Malema, Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, addressed SCA justices. “This is not an argument that we are advancing that an action for damages is inappropriate we accept one of the option available for Mr Malema would have been to bring an action proceedings but that is not the same argument that we are making which is an application inappropriate as a matter of law or not  which is the finding of the court of law that is what we are criticizing the judge and we asking the court of law to overturn we are not the development of any law or the change of any law simply the application of existing clearly articulate by this court.” Malema accuses former EFF MP of being set on tarnishing his political image:  Rawula’s claims Rawula also claimed that the EFF benefited from the VBS Bank looting.
