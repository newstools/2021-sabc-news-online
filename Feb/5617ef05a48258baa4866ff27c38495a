The High Court in Pretoria has declared the arrest of Noma Gigaba by the Hawks unlawful. The former wife of former Minister Malusi Gigaba was arrested on July 31 last year in Waterkloof at the home she shares with her politically powerful former husband. She was released on bail of R5000 the next day. Gigaba is accused of damaging a vehicle worth over R2 million which her husband had borrowed. She also faces a charge of crimen injuria following a text message she allegedly sent to Peterson Siyaya, a former unionist. She is due back in court on September 14.
