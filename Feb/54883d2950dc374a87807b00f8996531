Former Transport Minister Dipuo Peters is scheduled to give evidence at the Commission of Inquiry Into State Capture on Monday. Her testimony will centre around the alleged corruption at the Passenger Rail Agency (Prasa). In 2016 Peters said she was unaware of the level of corruption at the state-owned entity. She also claims former Prasa CEO Lucky Montana mislead her regarding the crisis and graft challenges facing Prasa at the time. Prasa’s legal head, Martha Ngoye, and the agency’s former chairperson, Dr Popo Molefe, could also continue testifying. Alleged corruption at Prasa Earlier this month, former chairperson of Parliament’s Transport Committee Dikeledi Magadzi told the State Capture Commission that they wanted state institutions such as the Auditor General, National Treasury, Hawks and the police to investigate corruption and the irregular procurement of trains at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa. She testified that her committee made recommendations for these issues to be investigated and the arrest of those who were responsible. She conceded that they did nothing as a committee to investigate and probe the alleged influence of the Gupta brothers on the state-owned passenger rail company. “The recommendations that we made [was] to say we believe the state apparatus should be able to make investigations which the chairperson of the board at Prasa took up and subsequently was not happy about how issues were unfolding,” Magadzi explained.
