Department of Health Deputy Director-General Anban Pillay has stressed the importance of getting vaccinated against the coronavirus both as individuals and communities to achieve protection and population immunity. Pillay and Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize briefed the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) on government’s vaccine acquisition and rollout strategy. “In addition to preventing morbidity and mortality, they also contribute towards herd immunity. So, I think it is important to emphasise that when an individual is vaccinated, he or she receives immediate personal protection against infection from a virus. In addition, when a significant number of people in a community are immunised, they then have protection and then that protection prevents the spread of the virus from one individual to another,” explains Pillay.
