Lenkopane says they are now waiting for the outcome of their appeal. “The matter is still to get to the attention of the DC [disciplinary committee] and all the other internal organisational processes. So I am concentrating on that but we have appealed and we reserve our rights constitutionally. We have since appealed but yes we have received such letters,” explains Lenkopane.
