However, there is some concern that the study’s sample group was not large enough. Berkely says this will also help in the coordination of the COVAX vaccine rollouts. He says, “We know that we need better global genomic surveillance and that has to be backed by rapid sharing of data to allow for the global coordination of response. Priority needs to be given to vaccinating high-risk groups everywhere to ensure maximum global protection against old and new strains and to minimise the risk of transmission.” Disappointment Political parties have expressed disappointment at the halting of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
