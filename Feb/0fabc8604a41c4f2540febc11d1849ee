Police say they have made a breakthrough in the so-called blue-light hijackings and robberies with the arrest of three suspects in Tembisa on Gauteng’s East Rand. The police have also seized firearms, SAPS uniforms and a white VW Polo. The gang’s modus operadi is to pretend to be police officers and then to hijack and rob unsuspecting victims. Some of the suspects have been linked to other cases of murder and robbery. They are expected to appear in the Tembisa Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Gauteng police spokesperson, Mathapelo Peters says, “The task team worked around the clock since the arrest of the suspects on Friday and have thus far been able to link one of the suspects to a series of serious and violent crimes. “The violent crimes include] including several murder cases and armed robberies committed between 2017 and 2020 in Brakpan, Kwa-Thema, and Tsakane, on which he was arrested and absconded bail. The investigation has at this point also confirmed that the three suspects are due back in court on 22 February 2021 for an August 2020, Springs business robbery case,” explains Peters.  #sapsGP #SAPS make a breakthrough with the arrest of three suspected blue-light hijackers linked to a spate of truck hijackings and robberies taking place on the R21 freeway in Gauteng. #TrioCrimes SW https://t.co/t2Ldu7pkAC pic.twitter.com/c2AmUaUYkR — SA Police Service  (@SAPoliceService) February 7, 2021
