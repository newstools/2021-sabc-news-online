The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has warned that it’s likely to add more charges against ANC secretary-general, Ace Magashule. Magashule is among eight people and five companies that face multiple charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering relating to the Free State multimillion rand asbestos roofing audit contract. The state alleges that between June 2015 and January 2016, Magashule either received or benefited from unlawful payments of more than R1 million from the late Diamond Hill Trading director, Phikolomzi “Igo” Mpambani. Ace Magashule appears in court:  Magashule is facing 21 charges of fraud and corruption, theft and money laundering. He was granted bail of R200 000 by the Bloemfontein Magistrate Court. NPA spokesperson, Sipho Ngwema, says they are ready to take the matter to the high court. “We did indicate that there will be some changes on the indictment. We indicated that we wanted to add more charges with regard to the last accused which is Mr Magashule. But also we wanted to add more accused persons on the indictment. So, this is what is likely to happen when the matter resumes and we are ready to proceed to trial. So, we think that we are going to move with speed to make sure that the matter goes to the high court and a trial takes place as soon as possible,” explains Ngwema.
