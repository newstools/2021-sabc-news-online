Former Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, has confirmed that AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). He is being treated for an ongoing diabetes problem. According to Buthelezi, King Zwelithini had several unstable blood glucose readings over the past few weeks prompting the decision by doctors to admit him to ICU for treatment. “Over the past few weeks, several unstable glucose readings have raised concern and His Majesty was required to visit a hospital in Zululand to attend to this,” the former IFP leader, who is also a member of the Zulu royal family, says. Buthelezi says the King’s health is being monitored closely, especially due to the risk that diabetes poses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “I therefore wish to assure the nation that His Majesty the King is receiving the necessary care for his diabetes as he has always done. As always, the Minister of Health is aware of these arrangements,” he concludes.
