The Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg is on Thursday morning expected to continue to hear evidence from Director of Crowe Forensics South Africa, Ryan Sacks on alleged corruption at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). Tshwane Trust liquidator, Hannes Muller could also give evidence. On Wednesday, Sacks said he was called to appear at the Commission by virtue of a summons as the report he prepared was confidential. He says he was appointed by Prasa to do the forensic audit of the investigation. Below is Sack’s testimony: Aswell Mashaba Earlier, Director of Swifambo Rail Aswell Mashaba did not appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture even though he was served with a summons. His failure follows that of former President Jacob Zuma who told the Commission that he would rather go to jail than appear before Commission chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Mashaba said in his letter to the Commission that the summons he has been issued with is not legally binding. Prasa On Wednesday night, former chairperson of Parliament’s Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba admitted that between 2014 and 2017 the committee failed to hold Prasa and its executive accountable. When she testified at the commission, Letsatsi-Duba cited various reasons for the ineffectiveness of committees including the executive’s unwillingness to divulge information in some instances and a lack of research capacity. “Being a member of parliament in any way is about upholding the Constitution and serving the people. If you have members in your party who believe another way, they don’t realise they are bleeding the organisation by exposing the wrongs. I always say these are our comrades, if there is anything wrong that is happening it is us who must tell them, it is us who must assist them to do the right thing.”
