South Africa’s coronavirus (COVID-19) death toll is seven shy of breaking the 50 000 mark. This after the country recorded a further 52 COVID-19-related deaths on Sunday, bringing the total number of deaths to 49 993. The country has recorded 1 168 new COVID-19 infections in the last reporting period, bringing the cumulative number of infections to 1 513 393. The latest figures are 279 less than the number of infections recorded on Saturday evening, indicating a steady decline in the number of new infections. This comes moments after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the country was in a position to move to Level 1 of the lockdown. “The country has now clearly emerged from the second wave. New infections, admissions to hospital and deaths have fallen significantly and continue to decline steadily. In the week that has just passed, the country recorded just under 10 000 new infections,” announced Ramaphosa. “We were able to emerge from the second wave because most people adhered to the tighter restrictions and observed the basic health protocols, including wearing masks in public and social distancing.” 52 1 168 1 513 393 9 077 479 33 141 49 993 1 430 259 *As at 28 February 2021 1 480 252 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); Recoveries currently stand at 1 430 259, representing a recovery rate of 94,5%, with 33 141 active cases.
