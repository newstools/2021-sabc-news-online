The South African Weather Service has predicted more rainfall in several parts of the country including Limpopo, Free State and the North West. The weather service says rainfall will last up until the weekend. Since Tuesday, parts of the Free State including Mangaung experienced heavy rainfall. Forecaster Puseletso Mofokeng says: “At this point, there are no records of extreme rainfall amounts over entire South Africa but in the extreme Northern Free State including Sasolburg, Orangeville and Frankfort much of Mpumalanga, Gauteng and the eastern parts of the North West including southern areas of Limpopo like Sekhukhune as well as extreme southern areas of Limpopo like Thabazimbi, we expect heavy rains in those areas.” Earlier motorists travelling on the N14 road between Vryburg and Kuruman were warned to be careful when driving on the road because of the heavy downpours. North West Traffic Management and Public Safety spokesperson Oshebeng Koonyaditse has advised that motorists should use alternative routes. “The downpours experienced since Wednesday night have led to flash floods. [The road is] partially opened this morning. Traffic officials have been sent there since last night.” “The road is now safe to drive on. But motorists are advised to drive carefully and adhere to the speed limit,” explains Koonyaditse.
