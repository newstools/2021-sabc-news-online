Gauteng police have seized another consignment of unregistered medicines, with an estimated value of R126 million at the OR Tambo International Airport, in Ekurhuleni. Police say the tablets, believed to be the drug, Ivermectin, had been found earlier this week during an inspection of a cargo container that came from India. No arrests have been made in connection with the latest bust. “The latest confiscation of the unregistered medicines is the largest bust concerning the illegal importation of medicines since the beginning of the year. In January, a multi-disciplinary team arrested seven people for the illegal importation of medicine, mostly believed to be Ivermectin. One person was arrested at the King Shaka International Airport, while six others were arrested at OR Tambo,” says Police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe. Mathe says all seven suspects in the January bust have appeared in court and are currently out on bail. #sapsHQ Unregistered medicines worth R126 million rand seized at OR TAMBO International Airport. #SAPS through its #Interpol office are working with authorities from India to establish the exact delivery address of the consignment in the country.
