Police divers are continuing the search for a missing fisherman from Paternoster on the Cape West Coast whose boat capsized early on Tuesday morning. The incident happened in the vicinity of Seal Island. The NSRI Mykonos had been activated and searched the vicinity of the nearby island, about five nautical miles from Paternoster, when the alarm was raised. Police divers joined the search party for the 35 year-old man, but without success until now. A fellow fishing boat who had found the missing fishermanâ€™s boat with a 14-year-old boy on it, towed it to Paternoster beach. The boy confirmed that his uncle had gone missing at sea after their boat capsized the previous evening.
