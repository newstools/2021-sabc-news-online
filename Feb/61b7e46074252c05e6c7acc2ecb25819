Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says government has reached an agreement with medical aid schemes in the country to cover the cost of the COVID-19 vaccination for their members. Mkhize launched the Electronic Vaccination Data System on Wednesday, which will allow South Africans to register for the COVID-19 vaccine. Currently, the registration process is targeting healthcare workers and Mkhize says the government will pay for vaccinations for South Africans who do not belong to medical aid schemes. Mkhize says, “Everybody who is at risk is going to be vaccinated, they don’t have to pay for it themselves. The Medical Aids will actually cover the cost of the vaccine. If you have dropped out of a medical aid scheme, you will have to indicate that. It means you will fall under the category that the government will sponsor and pay for. You must just give us the correct information. We will have to talk to the medical aid, they know, they have agreed. They will be able to cover it.” The EVDS system makes it quick and easy to get your #COVID19 vaccine. As per Phase One of the rollout plan, all healthcare workers should register on the system.
