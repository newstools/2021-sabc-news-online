The Gauteng Department of Education says it has to replace 34 teachers that it lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi told a media briefing that the schooling system is ready to welcome learners back to class on Monday. Lesufi says that there are still problems with last-minute placements, including that of over 30 000 learners who had failed to submit all the required documents. He says learning materials and personal protective equipment have been delivered to schools and that they’re making progress in finding substitute teachers. “Unfortunately, we lost almost 34 educators through COVID in our province we are now in the process of replacing those educators, through temporary appointments we have also welcomed 4 000 new educator assistants and we want to thank our President for this. They will be providing additional support to all our teachers to all our schools in Gauteng. KZN Education MEC concerned about high COVID-19 death toll of teachers The KwaZulu-Natal Education Department has expressed grave concern over a large number of teachers who have died due to COVID-19 related complications in the province early this year. The department says the pandemic is expected to put a huge strain on the new academic year. Despite the hard lockdowns last year, KwaZulu-Natal had the largest number of learners who sat to write their final 2020 National Senior Certificate exams.
