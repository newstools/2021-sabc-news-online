Cele has reminded police officers that they have a right to protect themselves. “There is war here. And we must fight that war. Because the fact that we have dead bodies here, it tells us we are under attack. And we must repel that and make sure that when the dust settles I am not picking up the dead bodies of the police. I must pick the other body. Not the police.” In the video below, Minister Cele pays tribute to constable Ndlovu:   Earlier, the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) slammed the killing of police officers, saying the issue can no long be overlooked.
