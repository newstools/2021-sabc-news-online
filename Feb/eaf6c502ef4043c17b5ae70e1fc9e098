Students’ movement SASCO in the Free State has rejected allegations that it’s supporting ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, in his legal battles. Free State SASCO’s convener Asive Dlanjwa says they have no moral obligation to support any accused person, especially those facing corruption charges. Dlanjwa says they view corruption allegations in serious light and they reaffirm their support for all law enforcement agencies. Magashule, 10 other people and five companies face more than 70 charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. The charges relate to the alleged irregular awarding of the more than R250 million Free State asbestos roof removal contract. The case has been referred to the High Court for a pre-trial conference in August. Addressing the media after his court appearance, Magashule said there are no charges that have been added to his current court case where he is accused of alleged fraud and corruption relating to the multi-million rand asbestos roof audit scandal in the province. Magashule insists he has done nothing wrong and says he’s hoping for a speedy trial. “Because justice delayed you know is something else. We are looking forward to the 11th of August,” he said.
