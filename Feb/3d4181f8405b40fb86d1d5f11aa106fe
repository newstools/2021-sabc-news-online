Ghana has become the first country to receive COVID-19 vaccines through the World Health Organization’s (WHO) COVAX facility. The arrival of the 600 000 doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine will mark the launch of the West African country’s coronavirus inoculation programme. Ghana has recorded over 80 000 COVID-19 cases and nearly 600 deaths. The key goal of the COVAX facility is to ensure equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines across the world.

This has drawn heavy criticism over what seems like vaccine nationalism. COVAX through subsidised funding allows for poorer countries to acquire vaccines. The WHO says Ghana’s consignment represents the beginning of what should be the largest procurement and supply operation in history. The facility aims to deliver about 2 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to various countries in 2021. Over 3.8 million confirmed #COVID19 cases on the African continent – with more than 3.3 million recoveries & 101,000 deaths cumulatively.
