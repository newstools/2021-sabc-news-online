The family of Hlengiwe Msimango, who was fatally shot by her husband in 2020, after he allegedly mistook her for an intruder wants justice to be served. Msimango’s husband Mosa Frank Nsibande appeared in the Kempton Park Regional Court on Gauteng’s East Rand on Wednesday where his case was postponed to April. This is to allow time for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether the case should be moved to the High Court. Nsibande told investigators that he pulled out his licenced firearm and fired two shots at someone he thought was an intruder inside their Birch Acres home in Johannesburg on August 3, 2020.  Hlengiwe Msimango, a mother of two from Kempton Park, Gauteng, was shot dead by her partner. He shot her twice in her chest because he had mistaken her for a burglar. #JusticeForHlengiwe pic.twitter.com/f0o0JVE80z — Man’s NOT Barry Roux  (@AdvoBarryRoux) August 5, 2020  The victim’s aunt Thandi Nkumane says it is still difficult for the couple’s children who are now in her care. “It is difficult but we are [surviving] … the older one is four years old.
