Police launch manhunt for Dimakatso Ratselane’s fugitive husband:  The Chairperson of Remmoho Network against Gender-based Violence, Mmathabo Leeto, says they demand justice for Ratselane. “We are really concerned about the delay that is been caused in terms of arresting the perpetrator because we do not know what he is thinking where he is. He may be doing what he has done so we want to call our police to expedite the programme or the campaign to arrest this man. This man we want him to rot in jail; he doesn’t deserve to be among the people. Let them unleash all the resources that they have to arrest this man.” A picket calls for justice for Lesedi FM presenter Dimakatso Ratselane:  Concerns over increase in GBV A group of women journalists and editors in the SABC newsroom expressed deep concern that violence against women, including female journalists, is on the rise. SABC economics editor, Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki, said they are shocked and devastated by the brutal attack on their colleague. The group committed to honour the best journalist practices of covering all forms of domestic abuse. “We are utterly gutted just to see the brutality with which our colleague was assaulted. This level of cruelty and the attempt made to dehumanise her and other women made us not remain silent. So, a number of us gathered in the newsroom to decide what we could do.” Thandeka Gqubule-Mbeki reacts to the brutal attack on Lesedi FM anchor Dimakatso Ratselane:
