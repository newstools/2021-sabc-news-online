Director of Swifambo Rail Aswell Mashaba will not appear before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture on Wednesday even though he was served with a summons. His failure follows that of former President Jacob Zuma who told the Commission that he would rather go to jail than appear before Commission chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Mashaba says in his letter to the Commission that the summons he has been issued with is not legally binding. Zondo says Mashaba has undermined the work of the Commission. “It obviously undermines in a very significant way the work of the Commission, when people who have knowledge of certain transactions and events that are relevant to the investigation of the Commission refuse to appear when they have been served with summonses. This may defeat the objectives of the Commission,” explains Zondo. The video below is the live stream of Wednesday’s proceedings:
