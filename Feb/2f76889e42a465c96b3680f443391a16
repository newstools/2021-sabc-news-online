Deputy Minister for Women, Youth, and People with Disabilities Hlengiwe Mkhize has expressed concern over the increase in the number of reported rape cases in the country. She was reacting to the crime statistics released by Police Minister, Bheki Cele for the period from 1 October to the end of December 2020 in Pretoria on Friday. According to Quarterly Crime Statistics, South Africa has recorded an increase in both rape and murder in the last three months of 2020. Over 12 000 people were raped in South Africa between October and December last year. The report also revealed that overall, sexual offences increased by 5% to 12 218. “It is very concerning the increase of 181 rape cases reported. It is clear that a lot still needs to be done in fighting gender-based violence and femicide. We are also looking at cases such as sexual assault and murder aimed at women, especially in the top four provinces: Gauteng, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal,” says  Mkhize’s spokesperson, Amanda Tshemese.    Minister Bheki Cele releases crime stats:  Farm murders Earlier, the Democratic Alliance (DA) called for Cele along with the National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole to urgently appear before parliament to account for failing to keep South Africans safe. DA Shadow Deputy Minister of Police, Okkie Terblanche says farm murders and attacks have also increased. “The police are losing their battle against crime. Rural safety remains a concern. 19 people were killed in 18 incidents of murder which occurred on farms and smallholdings. Farm murders increased to 63 last year. The DA calls on the Saps to immediately implement its rural safety plan. Gender-based violence continues to plague South Africans South Africa remains a violent society where women and children are particularly vulnerable.”
