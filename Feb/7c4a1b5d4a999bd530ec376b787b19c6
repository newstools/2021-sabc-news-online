The Democratic Alliance (DA) says the Gauteng Department of Education has incurred over R1 billion in irregular expenditure for the 2019/2020 financial year. The party says that according to the Auditor-General, effective steps have not been taken to stop non-compliance in procurement and contract management. However, the department says that it only incurred irregular expenditure of R14-million in that financial year. Gauteng Department of Education presents 2019/2020 budget: Department spokesperson Steve Mabona, says the R430-million spent on decontaminating schools last year, has not yet been audited. “The first error is to lump together audit outcomes for different years to reach this alarming figure of R1 billion. The second error is to contend that the department has failed to take remedial action against irregular expenditure. “ Far from it, the Department has progressively improved management of public funds and substantially reduce irregular expenditure. “
