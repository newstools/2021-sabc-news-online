South Africa’s rand firmed early on Tuesday, recovering from a slip in the previous session as optimism about the passing of a stimulus programme in the United States boosted risk demand. At 06:45 GMT the rand was 0.34% firmer at 14.8300 per dollar against an overnight close of 14.8800 in New York. US President Joe Biden’s administration is pushing hard to conclude a $1.9 trillion stimulus package. Analysts see the massive fiscal spending, coupled with continued ultra-easy Federal Reserve monetary policy, dragging down the dollar in the longer term, feeding demand for risk assets. “The rand was supported by US stimulus optimism while better-than-expected fiscal revenue performance ahead of the February budget speech boosted sentiment,” said analysts at NKC African Economics in a note. “We continue to expect that a favourable external backdrop, shaped by a policy-led correction in the dollar, will support the risk-sensitive rand.” The rand has also been supported by better than expected revenue collection, rising commodity prices and a trade surplus led by exports. With no major data due on Tuesday trade is expected to be choppy, with markets also eyeing the local rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Bonds edged firmer, with the yield on the benchmark 2030 issue down 2 basis points to 8.49%.
