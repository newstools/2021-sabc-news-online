Basic Education says a total of 24 000 learners still need to be placed in schools across the country. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga was addressing a media conference in Pretoria.  She says the demand for space in schools, especially for grades one and eight learners, remains a challenge. The department says it is all systems go for schools to reopen on Monday. The first term will end on the 23 of April. The minister says provinces will work with speed to place all learners this coming week. Motshekga has appealed to parents to cooperate with officials at district level to accelerate the placement process. Education stakeholders express concern about the opening of public schools on Monday:  Matric paper leak The DBE says the leakage of matric examination question papers last year was not that widespread and did not affect the integrity of the matric results. One person is on trial for leaking the leaking the Physical Science and Mathematics papers. Chairperson of the National Examination Irregularities Committee, Luvuyo Bono, says investigations found that there was no collusion. “What appeared from the investigation was that the candidates had in fact shown that they had done the work individually and that there was no evidence of collusion and that the leaks had really came out or spread through a WhatsApp message. Based on the evidence that had been collected through the investigation a recommendation on the basis that the 2020 combined exams were not compromised which we accepted and we are happy with it,” he says.
