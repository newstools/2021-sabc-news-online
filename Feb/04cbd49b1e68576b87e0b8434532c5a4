The Hawks have arrested three senior government officials in Bloemfontein relating to their alleged involvement in the multimillion asbestos contract. Hawks Spokesperson, Katlego Mogale, says the allegations relate to a contract that was awarded through a fraudulent procurement process. The contract was meant to identify and remove asbestos roofs in the Free State. Eight people, including former Free State Premier and ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, are out on bail ranging between R50 000 and R500 000 on charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. They will be back in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Friday. Mogale says the three suspects will also appear tomorrow in Bloemfontein. “Three suspects were arrested this morning following a crime-intelligence-driven investigation with regards to the asbestos saga that we have been investigating. The three suspects are suspected to have colluded and will be facing charges of corruption as they appear tomorrow in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court.” NPA says it’s likely to add more charges against Magashule The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has warned that it’s likely to add more charges against Magashule. Magashule is among eight people and five companies that face multiple charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering relating to the asbestos roofing audit contract. The state alleges that between June 2015 and January 2016, Magashule either received or benefited from unlawful payments of more than R1 million from the late Diamond Hill Trading Director, Phikolomzi “Igo” Mpambani.
