African National Congress (ANC) MP Tozama Mantashe has passed on. The ANC Parliamentary Caucus says Mantashe died on Sunday night from COVID-19 related complications following weeks of hospitalisation. Mantashe is the sister of ANC National Chairperson and Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe. At the time of her death, she served on the committees of Trade and Industry as well as the National Assembly Rules. Acting caucus spokesperson Nomfanelo Kota says Mantashe will be remembered for her dedication towards improving the lives of the working class. “As Caucus, we deeply feel this loss as her passing leaves a deep void and has robbed the ANC Parliamentary Caucus of a dynamic gender activist, a cadre who had a deep commitment to the improvement of the conditions of the lives of workers, a working class leader and a champion of rural development and women’s empowerment,” says Kota.
