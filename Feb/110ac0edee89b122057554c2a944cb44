The African National Congress’s top six will soon meet with former President Jacob Zuma. This was confirmed by the party’s Secretary-General Ace Magashule in a briefing in Bloemfontein following his appearance in the Magistrate’s Court on Friday on corruption and fraud charges. He says the meeting is vital and should take place to allow for an engagement with the ANC leadership on the recent developments, which saw Zuma being visited by prominent people including Economic Freedom Fighter leader Julius Malema and Police Minister, Bheki Cele. However, Magashule wouldn’t divulge information about the possible discussion that will be taking place. Zuma continues to refuse to appear before the State Capture Commission, saying that he will rather go to jail, unless Chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo recuse himself. Magashule says he’s certain the meeting with Zuma will go well. “As the Top Six, the national executive committee has mandated us and have arranged to have a meeting with President Jacob Zuma which all of us who have been looking forward to have. So that meeting will take place, so I’m sure after all the proper arrangements have been made, we will inform you that such a meeting will take place. That’s the meeting necessary and important for the ANC.” VIDEO: ANC SG Ace Magashule holds media briefing post court appearance Zondo Commission The Zondo Commission will recommend to the Constitutional Court that Zuma be imprisoned for contempt of court for defying an order by the highest court forcing him to appear before the Commission.
