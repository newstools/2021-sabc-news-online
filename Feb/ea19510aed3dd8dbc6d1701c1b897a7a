President Ramaphosa addresses the Nation on COVID-19 response:  Acting Minister in the Presidency, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, earlier this week, said the Cabinet remains concerned over the high rate of unemployment in the country. According to data from Stats SA’s 4th Quarter Labour Force Survey, over 700 000 job losses were recorded between Quarters 3 and 4 of 2020. Briefing the media, Ntshavheni said young people constituted the largest pool of the unemployed. “It is disturbing that young people constitute the largest pool of the unemployed and African and coloured South Africans, as well as women, remain the most vulnerable groups in the economy of the country and this strengthens governments resolve to fast track measures to enable and support the meaningful participation of youth, women and black people in the economy of the country. This is in line with the recommitment of economic reform and transformation made by the President in the 2021 SONA.”  The total number of COVID-19 infections in South Africa stands at 1 512 225, following 1 447 new cases reported by the Department of Health on Saturday.
