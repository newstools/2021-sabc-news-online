The Gauteng Command Council on COVID-19 says a third wave of COVID-19 infections is still a distinct possibility even with the soon expected rollout of the vaccine. The council held a media briefing earlier today in Johannesburg. Chairperson of the Council, Dr Mary Kawonga, has urged the public to still comply with the safety protocols that is wearing a mask, sanitising of hands and social distancing. “So the risk of a third surge and a fourth surge still remains. Vulnerability to infection is still high in the population. Not enough people have been infected and even if they are the research has shown that they are still susceptible to the new variants,” she says. “So we do have to maintain the guard to non-pharmaceutical interventions. So the third wave is still a possibility and adherence to NPI’s must continue even if, rather when we start the rollout of the vaccine, we still have to continue with that.” SA and the continent urged to prepare for a possible third wave of the coronavirus:  Earlier this month, Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said South Africa and the continent must prepare for a possible third wave of the coronavirus. South Africa is the country worst affected by the pandemic in Africa and has only just procured a million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India’s Serum Institute. Mkhize said on the continent, less than 10 countries are able to self-finance with most needing the assistance of the WHO-led COVAX Facility to procure vaccines.
