The number of new COVID-19 infections is declining in the Tshwane Metropolitan area. According to a statement, there has been a steady drop in recorded cases, from 221 daily to 105 since last week Tuesday. A 96% recovery rate has also been recorded. Member of the Tshwane Mayoral Committee for Health Sakkie du Plooy says, “I compare figures recently of the first week in December then first week in January and first week February. In December we had about 111 cases per day, then second wave came we had 1 200 per day and even more on average. But now we are down to 214 and I think I’ve seen yesterday and the day before was even less than 200. Even with our deaths we are so pleased that there are less people dying.” Warning of possible third wave On Friday, the Gauteng Command Council on COVID-19 updated the province on the state of COVID-19 in the province. While the council confirmed the continued decline in cases, it warned that a third wave of COVID-19 infections is still a distinct possibility – even with the soon expected rollout of the vaccine. Chairperson of the council, Dr Mary Kawonga, has urged the public to still comply with the safety protocols that is wearing a mask, sanitising of hands and social distancing. The Gauteng Health Department plans to vaccinate 67% of the population against COVID-19, in a three-phase vaccination programme. It is still unclear when they will start to the vaccination programme.
