Political analyst Sandile Swana says former president Jacob Zuma wants to use the masses of South Africans that are behind him to force President Cyril Ramaphosa and Parliament to find a way of pardoning him for all his alleged criminal activities. Swana says with Zuma clearly in defiant of the Constitutional Court order, State Commission chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has got no option now but to send the police to go arrest the former president. “The Constitutional Court is not going to listen to Zondo or any other person, the NPA or the Hawks or any other person. They told Zondo in their judgment that it was not even necessary for him to come there because the power that he wants from them he already had them.” “He should have either subpoenaed Zuma or arrested him and compelled him like any other witness. So Zondo has got no choice now but to actually send the police to go fetch Zuma and put him in jail,” explains Swana. Sandile Swana reacts to Zuma’s response to ConCourt ruling:  On Monday morning, former president Jacob Zuma reacted to last week’s Constitutional Court ruling, saying he will not co-operate with the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. The court ruled that he is compelled to appear before the commission and will not be allowed to exercise his right to keep silent. Justice Christopher Jafta delivers the judgment against Zuma:  In a statement, Zuma also says he does not fear being arrested.
