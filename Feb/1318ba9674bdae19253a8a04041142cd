Mpumalanga Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC, Mandla Msibi, says the cost of the damage caused by rains in the province has escalated to over a billion rand. Bridges, roads, and water infrastructure are among the valuable properties damaged by persistent rains. Msibi says water tankers have been dispatched to affected communities. “Currently, the figure is over a billion from the three district from the Nkangala District; almost R200 million in Gert Sibande; and Ehlanzeni which is the most affected. It’s more than R600 million. But currently, the premier has instructed us to look into our savings. So, we will start rolling out our action plan while waiting a declaration of the national disaster,” he says. Persistent rains wreak havoc in Mpumalanga: The floods have left a trail of destruction in different parts of the province. The City of Mbombela is the hardest hit, with roads and bridges having been damaged. At least 13 people were washed away in the rains. Some were swept away by flood waters while trying to cross streams, while others’ houses were washed away by the floods. Eight of the flood victims have been found and around five others remain missing. A search for them continues. Rita Mzimela, from Kanyamazane, has a relative who is yet to be found. “As the family, we are heartbroken. They say he has been seen, but they are unable to recover him. Some are being found while he has not been found. We don’t know what to do,” says Mzimela. Recent rains in Mpumalanga claim lives, damage infrastructure:  The Nkomazi Local Municipality, Bushbuckridge, Thaba Chweu and Mkhondo are some of the affected areas. Premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane said on Wednesday the province will approach the national government for financial support.
