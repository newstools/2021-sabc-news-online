The bail application of a 34-year-old woman who is the alleged mastermind in the killing of her husband and her three co-accused has been postponed at the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court in Limpopo to next week. Ntanganedzeni Nemaranzhe and her three co-accused, allegedly murdered businessman, Azwifaneli Mudau on Valentine’s Day in 2019. Nemaranzhe is accused of hiring four men to kill her husband, Azwifaneli Mudau in Makwarela, outside Thohoyandou on February 14, two years ago. Mudau was lured home where he found the accused at the gate, and he was gunned down.  Nemaranzhe and three co-accused, Tshivhangwaho Mudau, Tshililo Madega and Takalani Nemutandani were arrested in December last year. The fourth man who was hired in the killing is now deceased. The man was killed before the group was arrested, allegedly by two of the accused, Madega and Nemutandanani. The two are facing a separate murder charge for killing the fifth suspect. Two of the accused, Nemutandani and Mudau abandoned their bail application last week. Madega who is proceeding with bail application concluded his testimony last week.  The bail application which was set to proceed today was postponed to give Madega’s lawyer time to recover from an illness. Mmbudzeni Ramavhale, who is representing Madega told the court that he was not feeling well and as a result he could not proceed with the matter. A submission made by Ntanganedzeni Nemaranzhe’s lawyer for the matter to proceed was rejected by the court. The remaining four accused, including Azwifaneli Mudau’s wife, have been remanded in custody until their next court appearance on Monday.
