Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says once the COVID-19 vaccine, AstraZeneca, arrives in the country, samples will be taken to a laboratory for quality assurance checks before the rollout. The one million doses are expected to arrive at the OR Tambo International Airport on Monday. The first consignment of the vaccine will target frontline workers. The second batch of 500 000 jabs is scheduled to arrive later in February. Mkhize says it will take about ten days before the rollout begins. “So they will check if it is indeed the vaccine that we had asked for and then they must also check if there is any contamination into those vaccines. Once they’ve got that cleared they will then issue a quality assurance certificate. The key issue here is that the safety of our people is paramount and the safety of the vaccines and the quality of the vaccine has to be checked,” explained the minister. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize talks about the arrival  of the COVID-19 vaccine:  Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa will be at the airport to receive the vaccines. South Africa has been one of the slowest among major emerging market nations to secure enough vaccines for the majority of its population.
