The United Nations is calling for increased funding and support for women and girls wishing to pursue careers in science. In a statement released ahead of the International Day for Women and Girls in Science to be marked on Thursday, UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo–Ngcuka says the world must step up efforts to close the glaring gender gaps in science, and address the norms and stereotypes that create and preserve expectations of limited career paths for girls. Mlambo-Ngcuka noted that women continue to be underrepresented in areas critical to the future of work, such as renewable energy and digital fields. Only 3% of female students are in higher education choosing information and communication technologies. An upcoming report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation shows that only 33% of researchers are women, despite the fact that they represent 45 and 55% of students at the Bachelor’s and Masters levels of study respectively, and 44% of those enrolled in PhD programmes. She concludes that women scientists are a source of inspiration for young girls around the world eager to enter scientific fields. This year’s day will be celebrated under the theme “Women Scientists at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19” and will gather together experts working in fields related to the pandemic from different parts of the world. The event will be held at the United Nations headquarters virtually. On #February11 Ms. Olivia Cohn, 12-year-old Girl in Science Advocate (USA) will moderate the Opening Segment of the 6th Intl. Day of Women & Girls in Science.
