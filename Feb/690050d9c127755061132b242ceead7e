President Cyril Ramaphosa and Deputy President David Mabuza have received the first batch of AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine at the OR Tambo International Airport. The first shots of the vaccine will be used to inoculate healthcare workers amid a surge in infections. South Africa has been the worst hit on the African continent and has reported the most cases so far. The country has seen a big surge in infections in January driven by a new, more contagious variant of the virus called 501Y.V2. Ramaphosa says he’s delighted the vaccine is here.  He says, “Today marks a major milestone in our fight against the coronavirus pandemic as we receive our first consignment of the vaccine. This batch will benefit our healthcare workers who have been at the forefront of keeping us all safe.”
