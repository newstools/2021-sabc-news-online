Former Eskom Fuel Resource Manager, Dr. Ayanda Nteta has testified about the power utilities’ decision to make a R659 million pre-payment to Gupta-owned Tegeta Resources. In her testimony before the State Capture Inquiry, Nteta said the coal miner had approached her with an unsolicited proposal. However, Eskom would need to prepay for coal it had not received yet. Dr. Ayanda Nteta said she engaged her superiors which included former Eskom CEO Matshela Koko about the condition of a prepayment. This as Eskom had never made a prepayment for coal and the decision to approve a proforma invoice fell outside of her delegation of authority. The Commission hears evidence from Dr Ayanda Nteta:  However, after discussing the matter with her immediate superior, the paperwork for the R659 million was prepared and initialed over a weekend. Nteta has since been accused of colluding with the company secretary to get approval for the prepayment. Earlier, Associate Law Professor Richard Calland said there needs to be more meaningful dialogue between parliament and the executive for proper oversight to occur. On Monday, Commission chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo expressed disappointment at Parliament’s failure to exercise its oversight role on SOEs. Calland, who’s written a report on the workings of parliament, testified about how the National Assembly’s role can be enhanced. Calland said political culture, particularly within the governing party, is critical to the level of oversight that parliament can perform.
