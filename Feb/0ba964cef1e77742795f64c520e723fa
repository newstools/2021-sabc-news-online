Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has found that former Home Affairs Minister, Malusi Gigaba breached Parliament’s Executive Ethics Code in the naturalisation of members of the Gupta family. Gigaba failed to declare the naturalisation to Parliament within a period of 14 days. However, the investigation found that Gigaba did not abuse his powers by granting the family early naturalisation in 2015. The Public Protector’s investigation followed a complaint by EFF MP Floyd Shivambu. The report found that Gigaba granted the citizenship without proper validation of the requisite exceptional circumstances. Mkhwebane has recommended that the Home Affairs Director-General takes action against officials who were involved in the naturalisation of the family for their failure to exercise due diligence. The Public Protector Spokesperson Oupa Segalwe says, “The Minister did not abuse powers. He was afforded in terms of the law when granting certificates of early naturalisation to the Guptas. The PP found that the Minister merely exercised the discretion that he was entitled to in terms of the SA Citizenship Amendment Act of 2010. And that in the Minister’s opinion, there were exceptional circumstances that warranted the decision he took in respect of the Guptas.”
