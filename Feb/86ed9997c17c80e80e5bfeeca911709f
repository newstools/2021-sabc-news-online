University of KwaZulu-Natal Health Professor Mosa Moshabela, says ruling out a controversial theory that COVID-19 came from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, is inconclusive at this point. A WHO expert says it’s unlikely that the coronavirus was leaked from a Chinese lab, but is more likely to have jumped to humans from an animal. WHO food safety and animal diseases expert Peter Ben Embarek, made the assessment at the end of a visit to Wuhan, where a team of scientists is investigating the possible origins of the coronavirus. The first cases were discovered in the city in December 2019. Moshabela says the fact that they are not going to look at the laboratory theory as the origin of the virus before concluding the investigation, that may easily redirect the public’s focus. “You are doing an outbreak investigation which to a large extent China has done and the WHO mission we have patients presenting with the symptoms but where the source of the infection is. They have to then to do further studies to try and find more conclusive evidence at this point. I think what they are doing is systematic but what they should do is to provide evidence to dispute some of the theories that were there that they are not necessarily considering and why they are not considering them.” WHO team probing COVID-19 origins in China briefing the the media:
