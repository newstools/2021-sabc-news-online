United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, António Guterres, has urged the G20 countries to endorse the formation of an Emergency Task Force to prepare and implement a global COVID-19 vaccination programme. Addressing a virtual meeting of the UN Security Council, Guterres says as some countries continue to rollout vaccination programmes, more than 130 countries around the globe have not received a single dose of any vaccine. Progress on #COVID19 vaccinations has been wildly uneven & unfair. The world urgently needs a Global Vaccination Plan to bring together all those with the required power, expertise & production capacities. I am ready to mobilize the full @UN System in support of this effort. pic.twitter.com/YSp8JIBIx2 — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) February 17, 2021  He added that equal distribution is the biggest moral test of the global community. “I believe the G20 is well placed to establish an emergency task force to prepare such a global vaccination plan and coordinate its implementation and financing. This task force will include all countries in which there is a capacity to develop vaccines or to produce them together with the WHO, Gavi and other relevant technical organisations and international financial institutions. I am ready to galvanize the full UN system in support of these efforts. The G7 meeting later this week can help create the momentum to mobilise the necessary financial resources.” Just 10 countries have administered 75% of all #COVID19 vaccines. Yet, more than 130 countries have not received a single dose. Those affected by conflict & insecurity are being left behind. Everyone, everywhere, must be vaccinated as soon as possible. — António Guterres (@antonioguterres) February 17, 2021
