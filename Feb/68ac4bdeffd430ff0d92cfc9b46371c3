The Commission of Inquiry into allegations of State Capture will on Thursday hear testimony from Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution (Casac), executive secretary Lawson Naidoo. The Commission will also hear evidence from Professor Emeritus of Public Law University of Cape Town, Hugh Corder, Parliamentary Monitor of Parliamentary Monitoring Group’s (PMG), Jennifer Rault-Smith and Corruption Watch Director, David Lewis. This week, it was supposed to hear testimony from former president Jacob Zuma. But he pulled a no-show on Monday, violating a Constitutional Court ruling which ordered that he testifies at the commission. However, Zuma says he is not confident that the Commission will be fair towards him. He has vowed not to appear before commission chairperson, Justice Raymond Zondo. The commission has said it will approach the Constitutional Court to have the former president jailed for contempt of court. Monday’s proceedings in the video below:
