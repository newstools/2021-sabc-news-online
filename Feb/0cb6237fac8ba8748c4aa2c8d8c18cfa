African National Congress (ANC) veteran Cheryl Carolus has appealed to former president Jacob Zuma and party Secretary-General Ace Magashule to respect the South African Constitution. This after Magashule came out in support of Zuma’s defiance of a Constitutional Court order to appear before the State Capture Commission. Magashule said he believed there was “nothing wrong” with Zuma’s decision to defy the court. Zuma recently announced that he would not obey summons to appear before the Commission from February 15 to 19. The Secretary of the Commission has been instructed to lay a criminal complaint against Zuma for walking out of the commissions proceedings in November last year. Carolus has described Magashule’s comments as unacceptable. “That is an unacceptable statement, particularly by the ANC – an organisation whose legacy is rich for having fought and sacrificed many people’s lives. Nelson Mandela and his comrades spent 27 years in jail, and it was the proudest day of their lives when that Constitution was adopted and I don’t think any ANC member must allow a leader of the ANC to trample on that achievement. It is unacceptable.” Magashule speaks to the media about Zuma’s decision not to appear before the State Capture Commission:  Speaking to reporters in Soweto, Johannesburg, Magashule slammed calls for Zuma to be disciplined and removed from the ANC. BUSA urges Zuma to appear before the commission Business Unity South Africa (BUSA) has also added their voice urging Zuma to appear before the commission, saying he is not above the law. The Zondo Commission says it will announce further actions against Zuma should he fail to appear in February. BUSA’s President Sipho Pityana says it is clear that there are questions that he is required to respond to over allegations of State Capture.
