Learners from three schools  in Mmukubyane Village in Moretele, in the North West, have not been attending school for the past three days, after a 13-year-old learner was attacked and raped on her way home from school. Parents accuse the provincial Department of Community Safety and Transport of not providing learners with scholar transport. Learners have to walk more than seven kilometers through bushy areas to get to school. The rape survivor’s mother says if the children had been provided with scholar transport, this incident would not have happened. “Am very sad, and am very down because my daughter is 13 years old, that suspect broke her. Unfortunately at that school the principal did not raise the case of transport. Transport is supposed to be available on the 25 of January as schools open on the 27 of January, by that time when the incident happen, she was suppose to be in a bus coming back home,” she says.
