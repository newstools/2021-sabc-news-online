The widow of former South African Communist Party (SACP) general-secretary and African National Congress (ANC) leader Moses Kotane has passed away. Rebecca Kotane was 108. Ma-Kotane died at her home at Diepkloof in Soweto on Sunday night. She participated in defiance campaigns in the 1950s. She was also one of the leaders of the 1956 women’s march to the Union Buildings and was those who mobilised towards the adoption of the Freedom Charter in 1955. Her son Ambassador Sam Kotane says the family will meet later this morning to discuss funeral arrangements. Meanwhile, Moses Kotane Local Municipality Mayor Ralesole Diale has sent her condolences to the Kotane family. In a statement, Diale says Mme Kotane will be remembered “as one of the strong women, a champion for that matter, who supported her husband both dedicating their lives to the struggle for freedom and reconciliation.” “As the Municipality, we mourn her loss and offer our deepest condolences and solidarity towards Kotane family, friends and all people within Moses Kotane Jurisdiction,” says Diale.
