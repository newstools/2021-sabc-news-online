 Durban businessman Thoshan Panday and his co-accused in the R 47 million corruption case linked to police tenders during the 2010 FIFA World Cup are expected to appear in the High Court in Durban on Monday morning. Panday, former South African Police Service Colonel Navin Madeo, police official Aswin Narainpershad and former provincial police commissioner Mmamyone Ngobeni are charged with corruption. The decision to transfer their case to the High Court was made during their previous appearance in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on December 17 last year. Five other people, whose names were not divulged to the media, were also indicted to appear in court on Monday. Narainpershad was not in court when the other accused appeared in December as he was in quarantine because his son had tested positive for COVID-19. A warrant of arrest for Narainpershad was issued: In the video below, Ngobeni and Narainpershad were released on bail in the Durban Magistrate’s court in October:
