Labour union Democratised Transport Logistics and Allied Workers Union (Detawu) says other ways of saving the company must first be explored. Detawu’s deputy secretary-general, Nontembeko Luzipo says, “We will do anything in our power to close down Greyhound, we only received notifications of their intentions this past Monday. We view the speed of this process very suspicious. Firstly why they never informed labour if they were in financial trouble. Secondly why they didn’t opt for business rescue?”
