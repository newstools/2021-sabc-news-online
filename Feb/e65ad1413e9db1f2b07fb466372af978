COVID-19 vaccine nationalism is harmful for all, World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday, and said weak cooperation between nations is a major barrier to achieving worldwide vaccination at the scale needed to end the coronavirus pandemic. “Despite the growing number of vaccine options, current manufacturing capacity meets only a fraction of global need,”the WHO Director-General said in a piece published in Foreign Policy magazine. “Allowing the majority of the world’s population to go unvaccinated will not only perpetuate needless illness and deaths and the pain of ongoing lockdowns, but also spawn new virus mutations as COVID-19 continues to spread among unprotected populations,” he wrote.
