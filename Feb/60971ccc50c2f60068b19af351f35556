The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has confirmed that it is probing a complaint about the tender that was awarded to a communications company in KwaZulu-Natal. More details are emerging on the allegations against Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize. He and close associates allegedly benefited from COVID-19 tenders that the Department of Health had issued at more than R82-million. It is allegedly related to the provision of communications on the roll-out of the National Health Insurance (NHI) and later the fight against COVID-19 pandemic. SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago says, “The allegation is that there was collusion in the processes of the appointment of this company are questionable. We have sent the documentation to the department(s) that are concerned to look into getting us information. Once that is done, those decisions will be made and we will be able to know what really happened.” Below is Kganyago’s full interview on SAFM’s Sunrise programme:  Meanwhile, in 2020, Mkhize said all tender irregularities related to personal protective equipment (PPEs) must be exposed and investigated. He said a zero-tolerance approach would be adopted in fighting corruption related to PPE tenders. The video below is Dr. Zweli Mkhize’s 2020 address on the PPE corruption scandals:  Mkhize innocent until proven guilty The African National Congress (ANC) says Mkhize is innocent until proven guilty. ANC Treasurer-General Paul Mashatile says the party’s leadership will wait for Mkhize’s response on the reports. “Well, I saw the story about Dr Mkhize. I haven’t really heard his side of the story. So I will give him the benefit of the doubt that there shouldn’t be anything we should worry about on the matter. I’m sure he will come to Luthuli House and explain to us what happened,” adds Mashatile.
