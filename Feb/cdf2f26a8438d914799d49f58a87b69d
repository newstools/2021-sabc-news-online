Sundowns and Bafana Bafana player Motjeka Madisha will be buried at his home village of Madisha Leolo at Zebediela in Limpopo on Saturday. Madisha died in a car crash in December last year at the age of 25. His burial was delayed as the family waited for DNA test results to confirm that the remains that we burnt beyond recognition were his. Football fans, team management and community members have gathered at Madisha’s home. Family spokesperson Fanie Tsela says it is an emotional day. “It’s an emotional day today but we appreciate the fact the family can now find closure and off course the healing process can now start, our gratitude goes to Mamelodi Football Club, management, players and technical team and also the contributions made by the Gauteng MEC for education.” SAFA’s Danny Jordaan sends condolences to the Motjeka Madisha family:  Bafana Bafana coach Molefe Ntseki says  Madisha has represented and defended the country with dignity in all the national teams. Some football supporters say they are heartbroken: “As Mamelodi Sundowns supporters we are very sad, we lost our brother Motjeka Madisha and that is why we are here to bury as a team, as a supporter as a Sundowns family we are very sad.” “Actually from my side he is a homeboy, everytime I am going to miss him, when I go to the grandstand I am chanting his name I am going to miss those moments.” A brief look at Madisha’s football career in the video below:
