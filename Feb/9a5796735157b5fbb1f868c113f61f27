President Cyril Ramaphosa has granted the late struggle veteran Alfred Duma a special official provincial funeral. The 94-year-old Duma spent ten years on Robben Island when the African National Congress was a banned organisation. He was incarcerated with struggle stalwarts like former President Nelson Mandela and Ahmed Kathrada. In a statement, KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says Duma will be laid to rest on Tuesday in a special official funeral in Ladysmith. He credits Duma as being among the first to work to remove the apartheid government when he joined Umkhonto we Sizwe in 1961. Duma was awarded the Order of Mendi for Bravery in Silver in 2013. Zikalala says Duma’s life was spent in trade unionism, community activism and the armed struggle.
