Former State Security Agency (SSA) Director-general Arthur Fraser says he plans to lay perjury charges against the former chairperson of the High-Level Review Panel into the State Security Agency, Sydney Mufamadi, the agency’s acting Director-General Loyiso Jafta as well as Mr ‘Y’ and Ms ‘K’. Fraser says he wants police to investigate the evidence which the four have given to the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Mufamadi alleged that R84 million was given to former President Jacob Zuma in his last two years in office while Fraser was at the helm. Fraser was Director-General of the agency from September 2016 to April 2018. What came of the findings of the Mufamadi review panel?  Last week, Mufamadi told the Commission that the panel found that there had been politicisation and factionalisation of the intelligence community over the past 10 years in contravention of the Constitution. The panel was appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa in 2018 to investigate whether the SSA was conducting itself as a professional national service. Mufamadi said the malfeasance, where the intelligence community was appropriated for factional battles in the African National Congress (ANC), began with a 2009 proclamation by President Jacob Zuma merging the country’s intelligence agencies into the SSA.
