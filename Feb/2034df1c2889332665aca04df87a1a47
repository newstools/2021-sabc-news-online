The Provincial Commissioner of the South African Police Service in Limpopo Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba has welcomed the arrest and he warned the public against imposters. “Police will not request or demand cash for any reason during the recruitment process or investigations. The Police recruitment forms are not for sale and our posts are advertised on different media platforms with clear specifications. Members of the community must report these types of tendencies to the Police immediately,” says General Ledwaba.
