The World Health Organisation will issue its interim recommendations on the use of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University on Wednesday at 1500 GMT, a statement said. The press conference by its panel of experts known as SAGE (Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation) was moved up from the original schedule of Thursday mid-day. South Africa has paused the rollout of the vaccine following data in a small clinical trial that showed it did not protect against mild to moderate illness from the 501Y.V2 variant of the coronavirus now dominant in the country.
