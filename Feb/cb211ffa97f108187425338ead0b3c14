The families of the three miners who died following a tragic incident at the Lilly mine in Mpumalanga are still seeking closure five years later. On this day in 2016, a container at the mine entrance collapsed and buried Yvonne Mnisi, Pretty Nkambule and Solomon Nyirenda. Their bodies remain underground. Spokesperson for the families and former Lily Mine worker, Harry Mazibuko, says with the help of Action SA leader Herman Mashaba they will approach the high court to force the mine’s business rescue practitioners to reopen the mine to retrieve the bodies. “In the coming week, we are going to make our submissions to the High Court to compel the Business Rescue practitioners to do what they are supposed to do. Remember the management of the company hasn’t got money to sink the new decline which is the way that goes to the underground so that we will continue with the process of retrieving the container. It is unfortunate that you have to spend thousands of rands just to tell somebody to do his responsibilities,” explains Mazibuko.
