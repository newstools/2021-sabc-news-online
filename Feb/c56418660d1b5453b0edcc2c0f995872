The case against ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule and his co-accused have been moved to the Free State High Court for pre-trial. The matter has been set down for August 11, 2021. Magashule and his 14 co-accused appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court this morning. One of the suspects didn’t appear in court and a warrant of arrest has been issued for him. The other suspects are out on R50 000 bail each. They face several charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering. The charges relate to the alleged irregular awarding of the more than R250 million asbestos roof removal contract. The alleged corruption happened during Magashule’s tenure as the Free State Premier. Magashule says he is hoping for speedy trial. ANC Secretary-General in court on corruption charges:  A large number of his supporters filled the streets of Bloemfontein. Some came from  Mpumalanga and Gauteng, saying that they will always be behind Magashule. One supporter said the ANC SG is innocent until proven guilty and called for the unsealing of the CR17 statements. The bank statements contain the names of those who donated for Cyril Ramaphosa’s ANC presidential election campaign in 2017. More on the supporters outside court:
