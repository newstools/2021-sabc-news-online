Parliament’s Trade and Industry  Committee is calling for public comment on the eight shortlisted candidates for the position of National Lotteries Commission (NLC) board chairperson. The Committee says the list of nominees was referred to it by the National Assembly Speaker, Thandi Modise, after the Trade and Industry Minister Ebrahim Patel requested the committee to make a recommendation. The candidates are the Reverend Frank Chikane, Ashwin Trikamjee, Dr. Barney Pityana, Terry Tselane, Themba Dlamini, Gugulethu Xaba, Beryl Ferguson, and Muthuhadini Madzivhandila. Committee Chairperson, Duma Nkosi, says they will ensure an open and transparent process. He says the recommendation is expected to be finalised by next month.
