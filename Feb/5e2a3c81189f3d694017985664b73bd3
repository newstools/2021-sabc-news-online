The legal showdown between the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane is heading to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein on Wednesday morning. Mkhwebane has won the first round of the tussle in which she demands a public apology from the official opposition. She has accused the DA of publishing false and defamatory statements about her. This comes after DA parliamentarians claimed that Mkhwebane was a spy whose appointment as Public Protector was aimed at perpetuating State Capture. The DA has escalated the matter to the SCA in which it seeks to compel Mkhwebane to reveal certain records. This after a High Court ruling dismissed the party’s application to compel Mkhwebane to produce the requested documents. The court ruled that it would be inappropriate and illogical for the DA to rely on the requested documents to prove the truthfulness of their statements. It was further ruled that DA parliamentarians, Glynnis Breytenbach and Werner Horner, had publicly stated that they had evidence to support their allegations. They include Mkhwebane’s application for the post of Analyst in the State Security Agency and her confirmation of her acceptance of the job offer. The party insists that Mkhwebane’s employment at the State Security Agency after her return from China is relevant to determine whether she has ever worked as a spy, or that she was a spy on the payroll of the State Security Agency at the time she was nominated to the position of Public Protector.
