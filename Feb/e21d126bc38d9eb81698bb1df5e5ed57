The borders were closed on January 11 as part of the country’s efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 following the moving of the country from lockdown level 1 to adjusted level 3 lockdown amid a surge in COVID-19 cases in late December. South Africa’s 20 ports of entry closed until 15 February:  Now, the restrictions have been relaxed following a decline in transmissions. This has seen the extension of the country’s curfew from 11PM until 4AM; the ban on the sale of alcohol and the reopening of beaches, parks and unbanning of religious gatherings, among others. A move that has been largely welcomed. President @CyrilRamaphosa: Restrictions on the sale of alcohol will be eased. The sale of alcohol by licensed premises for off-site consumption will be permitted from Mondays to Thursdays, from 10am to 6pm. pic.twitter.com/Ln2xBTctlD — Presidency | South Africa  (@PresidencyZA) February 1, 2021
