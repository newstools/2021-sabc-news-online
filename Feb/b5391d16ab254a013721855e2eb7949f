“I have a problem with this thing of when you are applying they want proof of residence around town only and to me, it does not matter even if I stay in Seshego, but if I want my kids to come and study in town it’s my responsibility to bring my kids in time to school or whatever the case might be. I can go out there to seek addresses from my friends. I can do that and I can get it but it will just be fraud.” One of the learners who joined the protesting parents, Naledi Mohano says she feels hopeless as she was not admitted to a school of her choice. “It’s heartbreaking to see that other children are going to school and I am not going to school. It’s just so unfair and we really wish to go to school. I am going to Grade 8 and I want to go to Noordeland and Noordeland has already given us a rejection letter and right now, I have lost hope.” A representative of the department, Cairo Sima,  told the parents to seek admission for their children at schools near their place of residence. “If you say you stay in Bendor, when you stay in Botlokwa, we will place your child at PEMPS. But remember, we don’t admit, we place. You will have to take your document to PEMPS with proof of residence. There are parents who have legitimate cases who are in town, but their kids are still at home and there are parents who are from out of town whose kids are in class and have left schools at the township. If you are from Seshego there are schools there. Those who are from town, there are schools here.”
