Muzikayise Malephane has pleaded guilty to the murder of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule. The 31-year-old Malephane has been appearing in the High Court in Johannesburg. It has had several postponements with the Pule family expressing disappointment:  Malephane has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. His lawyer has revealed that his client had been hired to kill Pule by her boyfriend, referred to only as Shoba. Apparently he didn’t want his wife to find out that she’s pregnant. Malephane was allegedly offered R70 000 to make Pule’s death look like a suicide. It is understood Shoba has been taken in for questioning. In June last year, Pule’s body was found hanging from a tree with stab wounds to the chest in an open veld in Roodepoort. Pule, who was last seen leaving her boyfriend’s home, had been eight months pregnant at the time. Malephane was arrested while travelling back to Gauteng from Mpumalanga. The murder sent shockwaves throughout the country amid the scourge of Gender-Based Violence (GBV). Wise4Africa releases GBV and Femicide report:
