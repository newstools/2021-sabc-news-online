Premier Oscar Mabuyane’s spokesperson, Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha says,”The State of the Province Address is a business strategy of how we are moving away from poverty, how we are dealing with unemployment and and it is going to be synchronised with the budget.” “Because the budget becomes our financials of how we are going to finance these programs. So in the budget and in the speech you will see a lot of relationships with national budget with private sector. Because we know that we cannot finance the development and transformation of our economy alone,” he adds. The 2020 Sopa proceedings were not without drama as SABC News’ Yanga Funani reports:  In 2020, unemployment was expected to feature strongly in the Premier’s speech, as citizens, particularly the youth, were hoping to hear how he planned to tackle the challenge.  “Cooperative governance requires spheres of government to work together in implementing development programmes like we are doing in the construction of the Cofimvaba Science Center.
