The rape allegations against Djs Fresh and Euphonik have been dismissed by the Chief Prosecutor. The complainant took to Twitter in January to accuse the two DJs of drugging and raping her. She also opened a formal case with the police. In a joint statement, DJ Fresh (real name Thato Sikwane) and Euphonik (real name Themba Nkosi) say the prosecutor found that the rape allegations were without merit. The docket of the rape allegations has been marked as Nolle Prosequi, meaning that the charges cannot be proven and therefore, the prosecutor is dismissing the charges before the case goes to trial. “As we’ve said before, these were false allegations and we are deeply saddened that GBV, a serious crisis in South Africa, was weaponised in this manner,” the DJs said in a statement. pic.twitter.com/HhU1EeHp8o — DJ Fresh (Big Dawg) (@DJFreshSA) February 15, 2021  Primedia Last week, Primedia parted ways with the on-air personalities.
