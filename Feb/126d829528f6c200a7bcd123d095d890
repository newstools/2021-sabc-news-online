Former Eskom Board member Mark Pamensky is expected to testify at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in Johannesburg on Thursday morning. Another former Eskom Board member Venete Klein testified at the commission. She said she sided with other former Eskom Board members that thought a Board resolution to authorize a pre-payment of R1.6 billion to Glencore Optimum Mine was actually for Gupta-owned Tegeta Mine Resources. Klein told commission chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo that she understood the payment to be for Glencore and not the proposed new owners being Tegeta Mine Resources. “When I looked at the right up, it actually said pre-purchase of coal to OCM and that is what made me understand that’s where the money was supposed to go. Chair at that time I was not looking at who the proposed owners were and bear in mind this operation was in business rescue. I don’t know the business rescue practitioners were talking to.” Watch the live stream below for Eskom related evidence:  The video below is of Klein’s testimony in 2020:
