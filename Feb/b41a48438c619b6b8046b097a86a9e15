The acting principal of the John Martin Primary School in Kagiso, west of Johannesburg, has been put on precautionary special leave after it emerged that he had been dismissed for sexual harassment and misconduct in 2014. The school is a member of the Catholic Institute of Education (CIE). The Gauteng Department of Education this week alerted the institute that Motsamai Molete had been fired as a teacher at the Phahama Secondary school in Mohlakeng in Gauteng almost seven years ago. The department’s spokesperson Steve Mabona says they became aware of Molete’s appointment at the Catholic school through a social media post. “The department then took a decision to convene a meeting with the Catholic Institute of Education on 10 February 2021, to discuss this matter further. Subsequently, the educator was put on precautionary special leave, while we are resolving this matter. Engagements will continue so that this matter is resolved amicably,” explains Mabona. In 2020, a 15-year-old learner was raped allegedly by a fellow learner at the Ecaleni School for learners with Special Needs in Tembisa, east of Johannesburg. Mabona said it was alleged that the 17-year-old perpetrator followed the victim and raped her behind the classrooms. Meanwhile, in the Eastern Cape, a high school principal has appeared before the Mqanduli Regional Court on charges of sexual assault. His arrest followed learner protests.
