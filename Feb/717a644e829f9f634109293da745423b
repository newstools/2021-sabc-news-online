SABC Digital News will stream the Minister’s address live:  Ever-changing world of technology Giving a keynote address on Thursday to the official start of the event, President Cyril Ramaphosa said the Department of Basic Education’s approach to teaching and learning must speak to the ever-changing world of technology to ensure good quality education. He said the government was on track to finally introduce the draft coding and robotics curriculum in South African schools. Last year, Minister Motshekga hinted the curriculum was in its final stages and developed for grades R to 9. Its rollout is aimed at developing learner’s ability to solve problems, enhance critical thinking, and apply digital and ICT skills, among others. The President has also reiterated the need to continue to invest in early childhood development as the foundation for development, and create policy certainty where it is lacking.
