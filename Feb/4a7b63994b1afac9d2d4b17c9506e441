Next week, world leaders, scientists, businesses, and civil society activists will convene to address some of the most pressing environmental issues facing the planet. The fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly will be held virtually for the first time due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Now in its 5th year, the assembly will focus on the need to adopt a green recovery strategy post-COVID-19. It will also look at the role of nature in sustainable development. The @UN Environment Assembly is the world’s top environmental decision-making body attended by government leaders, businesses, civil society & environmental activists. Major Groups & Stakeholders met virtually at the #GMGSF this week ahead of #UNEA5 https://t.co/a6pRCTgyjG — UN Environment Programme (@UNEP) February 13, 2021  The assembly will convene three days after the return of the US to the Paris Agreement takes effect, even as the globe struggles to limit temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. Host Kenya says it is already working on mitigating against as well as adapting to the effects of climate change, and while it only contributes about 1% of the Global Green-House Gas Emissions, the bill is high. UNEA-5 will provide leadership, catalyze intergovernmental actions on the environment, and contribute to the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).@CapitalFMKenya @UNEP @onjolo_kenya pic.twitter.com/MyBn4MIat4 — Ministry of Environment and Forestry Kenya (@Environment_Ke) February 16, 2021  During the last assembly, nearly 200 environment ministers committed to several issues, including reducing food waste and marine litter, to developing and sharing innovative technologies to fight global warming.
