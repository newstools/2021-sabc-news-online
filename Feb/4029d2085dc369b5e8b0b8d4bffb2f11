The Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries says there are indications that collaborative law efforts to combat rhino poaching are working. The latest statistics show a 33% decline with 394 rhino lost to poaching last year, compared to 594 in 2019. In the video below, Environmental Minister Barbara Creecy speak about rhino poaching:  245 of the rhinos were killed in the Kruger National Park. The department’s head of communications Albie Modise says the lockdown appears to have slowed down poaching “The arrest at the airport of Chien Leing who was arrested and found in possession of rhino horn without a permit and was sentenced to 5 years. That is an example that despite the fact that the lockdown had closed the country and limited movement, there were those who continued with rhino poaching,” explains Modise. In March 2020, game rangers from the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast have shot dead an alleged top poacher. Hi-tech systems notified rangers of the night time incursion by three men.
