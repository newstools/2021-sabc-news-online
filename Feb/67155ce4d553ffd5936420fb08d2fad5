Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has officially introduced the new Prasa Group CEO, Zolani Kgosietsile Matthews, to the nation. He made the announcement in Nyanga, Cape Town, in the Western Cape on Saturday. The state-owned Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has not had a permanent CEO since 2015 and Mbalula says Matthews’ appointment signals a positive change. The rail agency has been dogged by fraud and financial mismanagement problems over the past 12 years, which Mbalula says, were pronounced in 2015/16. “Irregular expenditure stood at R4.1 billion alongside fruitless and wasteful expenditure of R541 million,” he says. Describing Matthews as a “seasoned professional, Mbalula is hopeful that his “robust” understanding of international and domestic business strategy will help restore good governance and steer Prasa into financial health. “Today, the new is born, but the old chapter cannot be closed until we have stabilised corporate governance, management, commuter rail operations and resume the course towards modernising passenger rail in the country,” the Minister adds. The Prasa board has welcomed the appointment. Matthews holds a Master’s Degree in Public Administration from Harvard University and is currently employed as full-time as a Councillor of the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa). He also serves as the Chairperson of the Ports Regulator of South Africa. — Minister of Transport |Mr Fix (@MbalulaFikile) February 27, 2021  Minister Mbalula’s live stream below:
