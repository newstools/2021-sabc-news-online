The South Africa Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) is on Wednesday expected to stage protests outside Parliament and across the country over increasing unemployment and economic instability. SAFTU says the strike demonstrates their frustration against employers for imposing the burden of the pandemic onto the workers through mass retrenchments, wage freezes and brutal austerity measures. Statistics South Africa released the country’s unemployment figures on Tuesday.

There are a number of places we will march to including Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital this [Wednesday] morning, going to the Commission for Conciliation‚ Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) to protest the fact that the CCMA is no longer allowing walk-ins,” adds Vavi.
