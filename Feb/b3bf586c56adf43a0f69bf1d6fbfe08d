A man is expected to appear in the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday for allegedly shooting his wife after mistaking her for an intruder. In August last year, Mosa Nsibande fired a shot that is believed to have killed his 30-year-old wife Hlengiwe Msimango at their Birch Acres home in Johannesburg. Hlengiwe Msimango, a mother of two from Kempton Park, Gauteng, was shot dead by her partner. He shot her twice in her chest because he had mistaken her for a burglar. #JusticeForHlengiwe pic.twitter.com/f0o0JVE80z — Man’s NOT Barry Roux  (@AdvoBarryRoux) August 5, 2020  He told police he had thought there was an intruder in their bedroom. Nsibande’s wife reportedly woke him around 4am on the morning of August 3, 2020. She told him there were people in the yard at their home. He says when he heard steps inside the house, he took out his licensed firearm and fired two shots at someone he thought was an intruder. Nsibande says he then discovered that he had shot his wife. She was declared dead on the scene. The accused abandoned his bail application after activists against gender-based violence protested outside court under the banner #JusticeforHlengiwe, calling on the court to refuse him bail.
