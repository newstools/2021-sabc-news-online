The South African Weather Service has again issued a warning of heavy rains later today in some parts of KwaZulu-Natal, which could lead to flooding in some parts of the province. Weather forecaster Stacy Colborne says there is an 80% chance of rain in the far northern parts of the province. Colborne says heavy rains and thunder showers are expected to spread to other parts of the province from today. “With regard to warning we do have an orange level 5 warning for disruptive rain over the extreme northern part of KZN today as well as into tomorrow.  And a yellow level 2 warning for disruptive rain fall in the Eastern part of KZN as well as along the south coast. Yellow warning is for disruptive rain fall it’s leading to localised flooding of informal and formal settlement as well as low lying bridges and low lying area as well. The orange warning is the most severe warning leading to flooding in most places in that area,” says Colborne. Forecaster Thandiwe Gumede says strong winds may be expected along the coast on Monday. “For tomorrow as well still there is an alert for heavy rain and disruptive rain that is expected to result in flooding mostly over the north eastern parts also expected to start covering the whole of Zululand and the whole of King Cetshwayo and some parts of Ilembe as well as some parts of uMzinyathi and northern part of Umgungundlovu,” says Gumede.
