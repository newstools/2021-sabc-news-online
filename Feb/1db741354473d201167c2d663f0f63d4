Capturing the correct data will help strengthen the fight against gender-based violence in the country, says acting head of the Gauteng Community Safety Department, Sipho Thenjekwayo. He was commenting on the launch of the Gender-Based Violence and Femicide Data Management Command Centre. Ikhaya Lethemba Victim Empowerment Centre in Johannesburg is running the project. It is intended to give support and care for gender-based violence victims. It will also track response to the needs of victims. “One of the things which we have done as a province, is to take this data management and research very seriously. One of the battles we must win in terms of gender-based violence is data management. Data all over the world, once properly managed, it gives you an edge, you are able to fight, you are able to show the scale of the problem. You are not just being emotional about the problems and challenges on gender-based violence, but you have data to back it up,” says Thenjekwayo. Government has been accused of complacency in dealing with the scourge. Police need more training Police Minister Bheki Cele has recently conceded that some police officers need to be trained to fully understand the seriousness of gender-based violence. Cele, intends to open a unit that will specifically deal with the crime. He has sent out a strong warning to police officers that subjected victims of GBV to secondary trauma, saying they will face serious consequences.
