State Capture Commission chairperson Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has expressed outrage at revelations that four ANC MPs who voted with their conscience, were told that they would be disciplined by the party’s top leadership. Zondo was responding to the testimony from Makhosi Khoza who was ejected from her position as Chairperson of the Public Service Portfolio Committee. This after admitting that she had voted with her conscience in support of the opposition’s August 2017 vote of no confidence against former President Jacob Zuma. The Constitutional Court had a month before ruled that it is lawful for Parliamentarians to be guided by their conscience in voting for resolutions. “Somebody especially the Secretary-General of the ANC or the President of the ANC or the National Working Committee of the ANC says in effect anybody who has acted in accordance with what the judgment Constitutional Court has said will be disciplined by the party.” “I can’t understand how that could be said in the light of the judgment, I can understand prior to the judgment the Constitutional Court clarifying the position,” says Zondo. Commission hears Parliamentary Oversight related evidence from Makhosi Khoza  Khoza has also told the State Capture Commission that then-chair of the Finance Standing Committee Des van Rooyen reprimanded her for questioning SAA Chair Dudu Miyeni in 2014 on the national carrier’s rescue plan. She said that the bone of contention related to Miyeni’s plan to replace all old white pilots with young black ones in 2014. She says at a lunch engagement at which now-Deputy Minister of Communications Pinky Kekana was also present, Van Rooyen called her to order.
