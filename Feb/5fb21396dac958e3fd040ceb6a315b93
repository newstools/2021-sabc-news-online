The DA in Gauteng has called on Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula to fulfil his promise to scrap the e-toll system. Mbalula indicated that national government would provide certainty about the future of e-tolls by the end of next month. All toll fees, including e-tolls, are set to increase from the first of next month. DA Gauteng Shadow Transport MEC Fred Nel says, “We call on him to please stick to his promise this time around and not postpone it again like it has been done for the past 18 months. The only outcome that we would like to see in his announcement is the end of e-tolls as the Gauteng residents can no longer carry this burden.” Mbalula has also told Parliament, they plan to scrap more than 63 000 taxis by 2024 as part of the recapitalisation programme.  He also added that rail reform is a priority. Department of Transport spokesperson Ayanda-Allie Paine says the department is quite optimistic about this as it has support from the industry. “We are quite excited because we have the backing of Santaco and the taxi industry.” “The 62 000 that we are planning to scrap is just a bare minimum and we are looking at scrapping not only your old minibus taxis, but we are looking at scrapping the panel vans as recommended by the Public Protector,” she added. Regarding rail, Allie Paine says rail will still take the fore and they are still looking at moving most of the goods and most of the computer transportation to rail.
