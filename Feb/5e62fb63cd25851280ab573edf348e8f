President Cyril Ramaphosa addresses the nation on Sunday at 8pm on developments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The address comes as the country continues the rollout of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine against COVID 19. Live Stream:  Earlier President Ramaphosa said the National Coronavirus Command Council is monitoring the coronavirus infection rate ahead of Easter, as the holiday could become a super spreader event.
