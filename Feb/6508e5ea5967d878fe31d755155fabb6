Lawyers for former State Security Minister Bongani Bongo have applied for the corruption case against him to be dismissed. In a surprise move, Advocate Mike Hellens for Bongo, told the court that he intends to bring an application in terms of Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Hellens says on evidence presented, the state has not proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. This was after the state called its sixth and final witness, the investigating officer Lieutenant Colonel Vincent Mokoena of the Hawks. Bongo has said previously that he has ever been involved in corruption:  The application will be heard on Wednesday. Bongo, who is accused of trying to bribe then-evidence leader in the parliamentary inquiry into Corruption at Eskom, Advocate Ntuthuzelo Vanara, spoke to the media outside court. “We’ve listened to all the witnesses, they are all saying different things at different times. Their evidence does not add up. It painted a clear picture of a conspiracy of the people I always refer to. It’s unfortunate that some of them are no longer alive,” adds Bongo.
