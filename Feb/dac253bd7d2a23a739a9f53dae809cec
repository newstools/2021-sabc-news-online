The Gauteng Department of Community safety will be in attendance at the Palm Ridge Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, where a man is expected to be sentenced for the brutal murder of his girlfriend. Earlier, the court convicted Lungile Nxelelwa for the murder of his 27-year-old girlfriend, Keneilwe Pule from Sebokeng. Pule was raped and killed with a grinder before being set alight. Gauteng Department of Community Safety spokesperson Ofentse Morwane, says various Sedibeng NGOs will also be in attendance to provide ongoing support for the woman’s family. “This is one of the many cases that we have ring-fenced through our family justice unit to ensure that we provide psycho-social support and assistance to the families and victims of gender-based violence in the province. We are at a very critical stage of the case where justice is about to be served as the perpetrator will be sentenced. It is important that just like we did in other cases, we continue to walk this journey with the family and provide support through our professional staff,” adds Morwane. In January, a 29-year-old man was arrested in Brixton in Johannesburg in connection with the killing of a 20-year-old woman and her nine-month-old daughter. Chantel Ash and Tasneem were killed at a lodge in Mokopane in Limpopo. Police said the pair had checked in at the lodge with a man but he had disappeared. Colonel Moatshe Ngoepe said Chantel and Tasneem were found strangled and their hands tied behind their backs.
