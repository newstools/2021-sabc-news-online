Six people have been killed in an accident in the Mthatha Central Business District in the Eastern Cape. The crash happened during the early hours of Sunday morning. It is reported that the driver of a German luxury sedan crashed into a boundary wall at the corner of Sutherland and Blakeway streets and burst into flames. All six occupants were burnt beyond recognition. The provincial Transport Department has warned road users to obey all rules of the road. Transport spokesperson Unathi Binqose says most road carnages could have been avoided. “The MEC for Transport in the eastern Cape Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe is calling on motorists to remember that their lives, that of their passengers and even the lives of fellow road users are entirely in their hands and therefore urges them to take charge of their lives and ensure that we protect each other because  a lot of accidents that we are seeing on our roads are accidents that can be avoided and therefore we are urging people to please avoid such accidents and save lives.” Road safety – ten simple steps for driving safely https://t.co/NrC531kTnx #ArriveAlive #RoadSafety pic.twitter.com/L3ArNHw6ir — Arrive Alive (@_ArriveAlive) February 28, 2021
