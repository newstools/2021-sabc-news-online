North West Premier Job Mokgoro says he maintains the political power to implement a forensic investigation unit, despite the ANC interim provincial committee’s decision in January to suspend his party membership. Mokgoro announced during his State of the Province Address (Sopa) on Thursday that his administration will, with effect from April, establish a provincial forensic investigation unit. Premier Mokgoro reflects on his North West State of the Province Address:  The unit will probe allegations of fraud, corruption and maladministration within government departments and municipalities. He says the latest political developments have caused no hindrance to his plans for the province. “A lot of things that I do, politically, I do implement. Where it is necessary to seek concurrence, I do that. It does take a bit of time, but we try to do it as quickly as we can. Essentially, there is no political hindrance,” explains Mokgoro. The audio file below is Mokgoro’s full interview:  Earlier, the African National Congress’ (ANC) Interim Provincial Committee ( IPC) accused Mokgoro and four other members of the provincial legislature of colluding with opposition parties during the election of a new chairperson in the legislature. Those who have been suspended together with Mokgoro, said they have since appealed the suspension. The video below is Mokgoro’s State of the Province Address:
