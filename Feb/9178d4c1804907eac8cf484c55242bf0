President Cyril Ramaphosa says the government is on track to finally introduce the draft coding and robotics curriculum in South African schools. Ramaphosa was speaking on the first day of the virtual Basic Education Lekgotla, which is currently under way. The Department of Basic Education will spend the next three days discussing the future of education in the country. Teacher unions, school governing bodies, academics, and Non-Governmental Organisations are among those participating in this year’s virtual lekgotla. The President says the draft coding curriculum will be gazetted soon:  Last year, Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga, hinted the curriculum was in its final stages and developed for grades R to 9. Its rollout is aimed at developing learner’s ability to solve problems, enhance critical thinking, and apply digital and ICT skills, among others. The President has also reiterated the need to continue to invest in early childhood development as the foundation for development, and create policy certainty where it is lacking.
