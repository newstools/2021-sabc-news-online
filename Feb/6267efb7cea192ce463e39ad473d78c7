Chairperson of the South African Local Government Association in KwaZulu-Natal, Nonhle Mkhulisi has died. Mkhulisi was the former mayor of King Cetshwayo District in the Mpangeni area and former deputy president of the South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu). ANC provincial secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli says the party has lost one of its loyal and disciplined members. “Comrade Nomhle has been unwell and has been hospitalised I think over the past four if not five weeks. All of us have entertained the hope that she will ultimately overcome the complications related to COVID-19 and recover fully.” “Almost every second day we have been given reports of her being better. The next day [we] were told she’s getting worse. Now [we] wish to convey our sincere condolences to the family of Comrade Nonhle,” explains Ntuli. In December, KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport, Community Safety and Liaison, Bheki Ntuli succumbed to COVID 19-related complications in a Durban hospital.  [UPDATE] KZN MEC of Transport Bheki Ntuli has succumbed to #COVID19. He was a PEC member of the @ANCKZN. The party has confirmed his untimely death through Spokesperon @NhlaksNtombela. #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/X7OdzausLi — #TheLordOfTheMedia (@samkelemaseko) January 16, 2021
